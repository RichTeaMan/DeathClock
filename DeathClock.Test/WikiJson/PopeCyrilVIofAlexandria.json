He resigned a civil service position to become a monk in July 1927 (Paoni–Epip 1643). He passed his probationary period and, on 24 February 1928 (21 Meshir 1644), took his monastic vows at the [[Paromeos Monastery]], assuming the name of Father Mina el-Baramosy (Father Mina of the Paromeos Monastery). He was also known as Father Mina the elder.\n\nIn 1947 (1663-1664), Father Mina built the Church of [[Saint Mina]] in [[Cairo]]. He also used to pray in the [[Church of the Holy Virgin (Babylon El-Darag)|Church of the Holy Virgin in Babylon]] before assuming the papacy.<ref>[http://www.st-mary-mons.org/ENGLISH/holy_family_in_egypt.htm St Mary Mons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020324084755/http://www.st-mary-mons.org/english/holy_family_in_egypt.htm |date=24 March 2002 }}</ref>\n\n==Coptic Pope==\n[[File:Nasser and Pope Kyrillos VI.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pope Cyril VI with President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], May 1967 (Parmouti–Pashons 1683)]]\n\nFather Mina became [[Coptic Pope|Pope of Alexandria]] on 10 May 1959 (2 Pashons 1675). In accordance with the old Coptic church tradition, Pope Cyril VI was the only [[monk]] in the 20th century A.D./17th century A.M. to be chosen for papacy without having been a [[bishop]] /[[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] first. Before him, there were three [[bishop]]s / [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] who became Popes of Alexandria: [[Pope John XIX of Alexandria|Pope John XIX]] (1928–1942), [[Pope Macarius III of Alexandria|Pope Macarius III]] (1942–1944) and [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Pope Joseph II]] (1946-1956). After him, [[Pope Shenouda III]] was also a bishop before becoming Pope.<ref>History of the Coptic Church, [[Iris Habib Elmasry]] Volume five.</ref>\n\nPope Cyril VI elevated the Archbishop of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] to the title of [[Patriarch]]-[[Catholicos]]. [[Abuna Basilios]], who was the first [[Ethiopia]]n to be appointed Archbishop of [[Ethiopia]] by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Pope Joseph II]], became [[Ethiopia]]'s first Patriarch. Pope Cyril VI was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Star of Solomon by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] in gratitude. In November 1959 he laid the foundation stone of the new [[Monastery of Saint Mina]] in the Desert of [[Lake Mariout|Mariout]].\n[[File:Ethiopian court.jpg|thumb|Pope Cyril VI of Alexanderia in the Ethiopian court]]\n\nIn January 1965 (Koiak–Tobi 1681), Pope Cyril VI presided over the Committee of [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches in [[Addis Ababa]], the first [[ecumenical]] and [[non-Chalcedonian]] [[synod]] of these churches held in modern times.\n\nIn June 1968 (Pashons–Paoni 1684), Pope Cyril received the relics of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark the Evangelist and Apostle]], which had been taken from [[Alexandria]] to [[Venice]] over eleven centuries earlier. The relics were interred beneath the newly completed [[Coptic Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Mark]] in [[Cairo]], which was built under Pope Cyril and was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], and delegates from most other churches.\n\nCyril's papacy also saw marked the [[Zeitoun apparitions|Apparitions]] of the [[Virgin Mary]] in [[Zeitoun apparitions|Zeitoun]], [[Egypt]] (starting on 2 April 1968/24 Paremhat 1684).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/divine-intervention-0000603-v22n3|title=I Traveled to Egypt for a Miracle Cure for My ALS|date=2015-03-05|work=Vice|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeitun-eg.org/zeitoun1.htm|title=The Apparitions of the Blessed Holy Virgin Mary to Millions in Zeitoun, Egypt|website=www.zeitun-eg.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria|Seat]] of Pope Cyril VI was initially located in [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Azbakeya)|Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in Azbakeya, [[Cairo]]. However, during his papacy he built the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in Abbasseya, also in Cairo, which then became the [[Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope]].\n\nPope Cyril died on 9 March 1971 (30 Meshir 1687),  after a short illness. [[Pope Shenouda III]] spoke about his predecessor:  \"There is no man in all the history of the church like Pope Cyril VI, who was able to pray so many liturgies. He prayed more than 12,000 liturgies. This matter never happened before in the history of the Popes of Alexandria or the world, or even among the monks. He was wondrous in his prayers.\"{{cn|date=August 2013}}  On 20 June 2013 (13 Paoni 1729), 42 years after his death, he was canonised as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Michael|title=Coptic Church's Synod Recognizes Two Modern Saints by His Holiness Pope Tawadros II Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St Mark the evanglist 118th . |url=http://mideasti.blogspot.com/2013/06/coptic-churchs-synod-recognizes-two.html|work=Middle East Journal, Editors Blog|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria]]\n* [[List of Copts]]\n* [[List of Egyptians]]\n* [[Battle of Anchem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.zeitun-eg.net/stcyril6.htm Short Bio of Pope Kyrillos VI]\n* [http://www.zeitun-eg.net/stcyril6/enbio.zip Bio of Pope Kyrillos VI, long version (Zipped PDF)]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Coptic Popes of Alexandria}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-rel|oo}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Joseph II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]]|years=1959–1971}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Patriarchs of Alexandria}}\n{{Coptic saints}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cyril 06 Of Alexandria, Pope}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1971 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Coptic Orthodox saints]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Christian monks]]\n[[Category:Egyptian hermits]]\n[[Category:Copts]]\n[[Category:Coptic Christians]]\n[[Category:Oriental Orthodox monks]]\n[[Category:Popes of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian monks]]"
