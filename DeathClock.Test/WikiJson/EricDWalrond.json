Born in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana (British Guiana), the son of a Barbadian mother and a Guyanese father, Walrond was well-travelled, moving early in life to live in [[Barbados]], and then [[Panama]], New York City, and eventually England. He made a lasting contribution to literature, his most famous book being ''[[Tropic Death]]'', published in New York City in 1926 when he was 28; it remains in print today as a classic of its era.\n\nIn it are collected 10 stories, at least one of which had been previously published in small magazines. He had published other short stories prior to this, as well as a number of essays. The scholar [[Kenneth Ramchand]] described Walrond's book as a \"blistering\" work of the imagination; others described his work as \"impressionistic\" and \"frequently telegraphic\", reflecting his use of short sentences. The following extract from his short story \"Subjection\" illustrates his more lyrical narrative style:\n\n:''A ram-shackle body, dark in the ungentle spots exposing it, jogged, reeled and fell at the tip of a white bludgeon. Forced a dent in the crisp caked earth. An isolated ear lay limp and juicy, like some exhausted leaf or flower, half joined to the tree whence it sprang. Only the sticky milk flooding it was crimson, crimsoning the dust and earth.''\n\nMuch of the dialogue between Walrond's characters is written in dialect, using the many different tongues loosely centred on the English language to portray the diversity of characters associated with the pan-Caribbean diaspora.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEric Walrond was born in Georgetown, [[British Guiana]], to a Barbadian mother and a Guyanese father. When Eric was aged eight, his father left, and he moved with his mother, Ruth, to live with relatives in Barbados, where he attended St. Stephen's Boys' School, before moving to [[Panama]] at the time when the [[Panama Canal]] was being constructed.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/gah/walrond-eric-1898-1966 \"Walrond, Eric (1898–1966)\"], BlackPast.org.</ref> Here Walrond completed his school education and became fluent in Spanish as well as English. Following training as a secretary and stenographer, he was employed as a clerk in the Health Department of the Canal Commission at [[Cristóbal, Colón|Cristóbal]], and as a reporter for the ''Panama Star-Herald'' newspaper. In 1918 he moved to New York, where he attended [[Columbia University]], being tutored by [[Dorothy Scarborough]]. He was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.\n\n==Harlem Renaissance writer==\nIn New York, Walrond worked at first as hospital secretary, porter, and stenographer. His utopian sketch of a united Africa, \"A Senator's Memoirs\" (1921), won a prize sponsored by [[Marcus Garvey]]. From 1921 to 1923, Walrond was editor and co-owner of an African-American weekly called the ''Brooklyn and Long Island Informer''.<ref>Margarita Barceló, \"Walrond, Eric\", in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster & Trudier Harris (eds), '' Oxford Companion to African American Literature'', New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 754.</ref> He was then hired as associate editor (1923–25) of ''Negro World'', the paper of Garvey's [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA). He subsequently became a protégé of the [[National Urban League]]'s director [[Charles S. Johnson]]. Between 1925 and 1927 he was a contributor to, and business manager of, the Urban League's ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'' magazine, which had been founded in 1923 to help bring to prominence African-American contributors to the arts and politics of the 1920s. He was also a contributor to ''[[The Smart Set]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Negro World]]''. His short stories included \"On Being Black\" (1922), \"On Being a Domestic\" (1923), \"Miss Kenny's Marriage\" (1923), \"The Stone Rebounds\" (1923), \"Vignettes of the Dusk\" (1924), \"The Black City\" (1924), and \"City Love\" (1927) – the year that [[Duke Ellington]] began his career in New York and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] were founded. In 1928–29 Walrond was awarded the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for Fiction.\n\n==Later life in England==\n[[File:The grave of Eric D Walrond, Abney Park Cemetery, London.jpg|thumb|The grave of Eric D Walrond, Abney Park Cemetery, London]]\nAfter a decade in America, Walrond left for England, where he met English writers and artists during the 1930s, including [[Winifred Holtby]]. In later life he continued to employ his editorial skills from time to time, while working as an accountant.  He lived for some years in [[Wiltshire]], working in a factory, but in 1951 was hospitalised by his own volition for psychiatric care, which continued until 1957.  After he left the hospital he was involved in a theatrical production at London's [[Royal Court Theatre]] in the aftermath of the [[1958 Notting Hill race riots]].<ref>Douglas Field, review of James Davis, ''Eric Walrond: A Life in the Harlem Renaissance and the Transatlantic Caribbean'', ''TLS'', 19 June 2015.</ref>\n\nOn 8 August 1966, at the age of 67, he collapsed on a street in central London and was pronounced dead on arrival at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Following an autopsy, he was buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington]], on 17 September. His grave lies on a path edge in the southern section.\n\nAfter his death, which occurred while he was living in reduced circumstances, his early literary work has enjoyed wider recognition, as reflected in ''Winds Can Wake up the Dead...'' and ''The Penguin Book of Caribbean Short Stories'', both published in the 1990s, ''In Search of Asylum'', which appeared in 2011, and in James Davis' 2015 biography.  At the time, however, his passing appears to have gone relatively unnoticed, although [[Arna Bontemps]] wrote of his death, from a fifth heart attack, in a letter to [[Langston Hughes]], dated 1 September 1966.   [[Countee Cullen]]'s well-known poem \"Incident\" is dedicated to Walrond.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n'''Novels'''\n* ''Tropic Death'', New York: Boni & Liveright, 1926.\n\n'''Anthology''' \n* Parascandola, Louis J.
