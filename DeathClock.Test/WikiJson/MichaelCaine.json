Baker told Caine to meet the director, [[Cy Endfield]], who informed him that he already had given the part to [[James Booth]], a fellow Cockney who was Caine's friend, because he \"looked more Cockney\" than Caine did. Endfield then told the 6'2\" Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer, and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish, upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do a [[posh accent]]. Caine believes Endfield offered him, a Cockney, the role of an aristocrat because, being American, he did not have the endemic British class-prejudice.
