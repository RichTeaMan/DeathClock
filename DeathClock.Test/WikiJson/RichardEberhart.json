He grew up on an [[Estate (land)|estate]] of {{convert|40|acre|ha}} called Burr Oaks, since partitioned into hundreds of [[residential]] lots.  He published a volume of [[poetry]] called ''Burr Oaks'' in 1947, and many of his poems reflect his youth in rural America.<ref>https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/richard-eberhart</ref>\n\nEberhart began college at the [[University of Minnesota]], but following his mother's death from [[cancer]] in 1921—the event which prompted him to begin writing poetry—he transferred to [[Dartmouth College]].  After graduation he worked as a [[ship]]'s hand, among other jobs, then studied at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], where [[I.A. Richards]] encouraged him to continue writing poetry, and where he took a further degree. After serving as private tutor to the son of King [[Prajadhipok]] of [[Thailand|Siam]] in 1931–1932, Eberhart pursued graduate study for a year at [[Harvard University]]. During his time at Harvard, Eberhart met and spoke with [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Eberhart, Richard. Letter to T. S. Eliot. 9 Feb. 1935. MS. Richard Eberhart Papers. Stuart Wright Collection. Joyner Lib., Greenville, NC.</ref>\n\nHis first book of poetry, ''A Bravery of Earth'', was published in London in 1930. It reflected his experiences in Cambridge and his experience as a ship's hand. ''Reading the Spirit'', published in 1937, contains one of his best-known poems, \"The Groundhog\".\n\nHe taught for eight years at the [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]] (1933–1941), where [[Robert Lowell]] was one of his students.  In 1941 he married Helen Butcher.  They had two children.\n\nDuring World War II he held the rank of Lieutenant Commander and served in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]];<ref>[[Vernon Scannell]] ''Not Without Glory'' The Woburn Press ,London, 1976 {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref> this experience led him to write another of his most celebrated  poems, \"The Fury of Aerial Bombardment\", the first three stanzas of which, are in effect a prayer:<ref>''The Poetry of War 1939-45''  ed. Ian Hamilton, London 1965</ref>\n\n::Was man made stupid to see his own stupidity?''\n::''Is God by definition indifferent, beyond us all?''\n::''Is the eternal truth man's fighting soul''\n::''Wherein the Beast ravens in its own avidity?\n\n===Career===\nIn 1945, Eberhart published ''Poems: New and Selected'' containing \"The Fury of Aerial Bombardment\" and other poems written during his service including \"Dam Neck, Virginia\" and \"World War\". He also edited ''War and the Poet: An Anthology of Poetry Expressing Man's Reactions to the Present'' claiming to be the first collection of poems based on war.\n\nAfter the war, Eberhart worked for six years for his wife's family's floor wax company, the Butcher Polish Company. ''Burr Oaks'' was his first work published after the war in 1947 followed by ''Brotherhood of Men'' in 1949. In 1950 he was a founder of the Poets' Theatre in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].\n\nFrom the early 1950s until his retirement he dedicated himself to writing poems and teaching at institutions of higher education, including the [[University of Washington]], [[Brown University]], [[Swarthmore College]], [[Tufts University]], [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Cincinnati]], University of Florida, [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]], [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Marks School]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Dartmouth College]]. He taught for 30 years at Dartmouth as professor of English and poet-in-residence, where he was known for his encouragement of young poets.\n\nEberhart published ''Undercliff: Poems 1946–1953'' containing ''Fragment of New York'' in 1953. Eberhart wrote a number of dramatic works in the 1950s and early 1960s which were performed regionally. These works included ''The Apparition'', ''The Visionary Farms'', ''Triptych'', ''The Mad Musicians'' and ''Devils and Angels''. In 1962, these works were published as ''Collected Verse Works''.\n\nEberhart was sent to [[San Francisco]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to report on the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poetry scene.  Eberhart wrote a piece published in the September 2, 1956, ''New York Times Book Review'' entitled \"West Coast Rhythms\" that helped call national attention to the [[Beat generation]], and especially to [[Allen Ginsberg]] as the author of ''[[Howl]]'', which he called \"the most remarkable poem of the young group.\"<ref>Allen Ginsberg, ''Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Editions, Fully Annotated by Author, with Contemporaneous Correspondence, Account of First Public Reading, Legal Skirmishes, Precursor Texts & Bibliography'', edited by Barry Miles (HarperPerennial, 1995), 155.</ref> Ginsberg credited Eberhart's article with \"breaking the ice\" for the Beats in regard to getting them published.<ref>[http://raunerlibrary.blogspot.com/2011/12/i-saw-best-minds-of-my-generation.html \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness ...\"].

As well, Eberhart was [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] for 1959–61, and was awarded a [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1962.\n\n''The Quarry: New Poems'' (1964) contained letters in verse to [[W.
