Maitland began his career as a [[United States Army Reserve|Reserve]] pilot in the [[U.S. Army Air Service]] during [[World War I]] and rose to brigadier general in the [[Michigan Air National Guard]] following [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1927 Maitland and Lt. [[Albert Francis Hegenberger|Albert F. Hegenberger]] completed the first transpacific flight from California to Hawaii, flying the modified transport [[Bird of Paradise (aircraft)|''Bird of Paradise'']]. Although the recognition accorded them was less in comparison with the adulation given [[Charles Lindbergh]] for his [[transatlantic flight]] only five weeks earlier, Maitland and Hegenberger's feat was arguably more significant from a navigational stand point.<ref name=\"mom\">{{cite web | year = | url= http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=11449&qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisconsinhistory.org%2Fwhi%2Fresults.asp%3Fpageno%3D90%26keyword1%3DName%26search_type%3Dbasic%26sort_by%3Ddate|title = Maitland of Milwaukee| work =| publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society| accessdate= 2011-08-03}}</ref>\n\nMaitland continued his career in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]], serving in combat as a [[bombardment group]] commander during World War II. He later became the first director of the Wisconsin Aeronautics Commission and the Director of [[Civil Defense]] for the state of Michigan before changing professions and becoming an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] minister.\n\n==Early history and World War I==\nBorn in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] in 1899, Maitland graduated from Riverside High School in 1917. He enlisted as an aviation cadet in the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] three days after the United States entered World War I and was assigned to training at a [[United States Army Air Service#Pilot training|School of Military Aeronautics]] on the campus of the [[University of Texas]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in the fall of 1917. His flight training took place at [[Rich Field]] in [[Waco, Texas]], after which he received a [[USAF aeronautical rating#World War I and Air Service revisions|rating of Reserve Military Aviator]] and was commissioned on May 25, 1918 as a 2nd lieutenant in the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service, National Army]] at the age of nineteen. After a stint as a flying instructor, he was sent to gunnery school at Taliaferro Field, Texas, but the war ended before he could be sent overseas.<ref name=\"wahof\">{{cite web| year =| url =http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/maitland.htm| title =Lester J Maitland| work =| publisher =Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame| accessdate =2011-08-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716232351/http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/maitland.htm| archivedate =2011-07-16| df =}}</ref>\n\n==Between wars==\nFollowing World War I, Maitland was assigned to [[McCook Field]] in Ohio from November 1918 to April 1919 as a pilot with the Testing Squadron. Maitland was transferred to [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Ford Island|Luke Field]], [[Hawaii]], and assigned to the [[6th Aero Squadron]] on May 13, 1919. He petitioned to remain in the Army, passed the required examinations, and received a regular commission as a 1st lieutenant in the Air Service on July 1, 1920, the date that the service was recognized by law as an organizational part of the Army. Leaving Hawaii in May 1921, Maitland became an aide to [[Billy Mitchell (general)|General Billy Mitchell]] in July and was selected as one of the pilots to take part in the [[Billy Mitchell (general)#Sinking of the Ostfriesland|sinking of the battleship ''Ostfriesland'']], a military experiment set up by Mitchell to prove the effectiveness of [[aerial warfare|air power]] against ships.<ref name=\"wahof\"/> In September and October 1925 he acted as an aide to Mitchell during the [[United States Army Air Service#Investigating committees and boards|Morrow Board]] hearings.\n\n[[File:Curtiss R-6 racer.jpg|right|thumb| Curtiss R-6 racer]]\nDuring the 1920s, Maitland competed for the Air Service and its [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] successor in air races and pioneering flights as part of the service's program of generating favorable publicity.<ref name=\"huff\">{{harvnb|Walker and Wickam|1986|pp=207–209}}</ref> While Operations Officer for Col.

On June 24, while in [[San Diego, California]], the results of the tests were reported to [[Secretary of War]] [[Dwight F. Davis]] and he approved the flight to Hawaii. The next day they flew to [[Crissy Field]], at the [[Presidio]] in [[San Francisco, California]].<ref name=\"mau258\"/>\n\nOn June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger made the short hop from Crissy Field to the newly opened [[Oakland International Airport|Oakland Municipal Airport]], whose {{convert|7000|ft|m}} runway was much preferable for the takeoff roll with full fuel load, and departed the next morning just after 7 a.m. for [[Wheeler Field]], [[Oahu]], with Maitland as pilot and Hegenberger as navigator.<ref name=\"mau258\">{{harvnb|Maurer|1987|pp=258–260}}</ref> Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on [[Maui]], the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly cloudier weather, Hegenberger navigated most of the charted [[Great Circle]] route by [[dead reckoning]], using a magnetic compass and driftmeter supplemented by [[celestial navigation]] observations. Contact with several ships at sea was used to verify their position and adjust the original flight plan.<ref name=\"mau258\"/><ref name=\"snl\"/>\n\n23 hours into the flight, before dawn on June 29, the crew observed a lighthouse beam on [[Kauai]] in the Hawaiian Islands at their [[estimated time of arrival]], but still in complete darkness, decided to circle until daybreak before landing at Wheeler.<ref name=\"mau258\"/><ref name=\"snl\">{{cite web | ref=harv |last =Horvat| first =William J| year =1966 | url= http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-aviation-pioneers/lt-lester-maitland|title = Lt.

He was promoted to captain in 1932. Maitland served in various positions in the Training Command at Kelly, including senior instructor in Attack, to September 1934, when he entered the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] at Maxwell Field as a student in the comprehensive 845-hour, 36-week course. Making up the 59 members of his class were five majors, 40 captains including himself, 13 first lieutenants, and one second lieutenant. In addition to 49 Air Corps officers were four Army officers, one from each of that service's combat arms, two [[Turkish Army]] aviators, one [[Mexican people|Mexican]] captain, and three [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] aviators. Among Maitland's Air Corps peers were future generals [[Muir S. Fairchild]], [[Barney Giles]], [[Laurence S. Kuter]], [[Haywood Hansell]], and [[Hoyt S. Vandenberg]]; and aviation pioneer Major [[Vernon Burge]], who as a [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] in June 1912 had been the first certified enlisted military pilot. Maitland graduated in June 1935.<ref>{{harvnb|Finney|1955|pp=8, 72–73}}</ref> From September 11, 1935, to July 16, 1938, he commanded the [[8th Special Operations Squadron|8th Attack Squadron]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale Field]], Louisiana, flying the [[Northrop A-17]] attack bomber.<ref name=\"8sosfs\">{{cite web | year = | url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=10482&page=1|title = 8 SOS fact Sheet| work =| publisher = AFHRA| accessdate= 2011-08-09}}</ref>\n\nOn July 20, 1940, Major Maitland and his wife Kathleen \"Kay\" Maitland were sent to the [[Philippine Department]] for a two-year tour of duty in command of the [[28th Bombardment Squadron]]. By seniority he was also made base commander of [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], where the 28th BS was stationed. On March 13, 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and command of the 28th BS passed to a more junior officer, but Maitland remained base commander at Clark.<ref name=\"dec24\">{{harvnb|Bartsch|2003|pp=65,79}}</ref> Shortly after, the Army extended the tours of all Air Corps personnel in the Philippine Department by an additional year, fearing aggressive Japanese moves against the Philippines, and ordered their dependents to return to the United States. This created a serious morale problem that Maitland combatted at Clark, at the suggestion of a subordinate, by issuing an order in May 1941 that all base personnel (including himself) had to grow beards. He modified the order in mid-August, making beards optional, but he and many others maintained their facial hair.<ref>{{harvnb|Bartsch|2003|pp=89, 117}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nMaitland was on the headquarters staff of the newly created [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] when the United States entered World War II.

He organized the group and moved it on February 9, 1943, to [[Chennault Air Force Base|Lake Charles Field]], Louisiana, to complete its group combat training, which was accomplished without losses of any B-26s to accident in more than 10,000 hours of flight.<ref name=\"raf\"/><ref group=n>The B-26 had a reputation among pilots as a \"hot\" aircraft that was notoriously difficult to fly for novices.

Based at the new station at [[RAF Boxted]], the 386th did not immediately enter combat because extreme losses to B-26s of the already operational [[322d Air Expeditionary Group|322nd Bomb Group]], attacking at low altitudes, forced a suspension of all B-26 operations to develop new tactics. Over the following seven weeks the 386th embarked on an intensive training program covering aircraft recognition, flying control procedures, German fighter tactics, combat formations, and medium altitude bombing (between {{convert|10000|ft|m}} and {{convert|15000|ft|m}}),.<ref name=\"raf254\">{{harvnb|Freeman|''Mighty Eighth''|p=254}}</ref>\n\nAfter flying four diversionary missions in mid-July, the 386th BG began combat operations on July 30, 1943, attacking the [[Luftwaffe]] fighter base at [[Woensdrecht Air Base|Woensdrecht Airfield]] in the [[Netherlands]].
