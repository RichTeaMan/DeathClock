The Orthodox Presbyterian Church's newsletter, ''The Presbyterian Guardian'', reported in July 1958 that \"the Rev. Rousas J.

North and Rushdoony became collaborators and their partnership lasted until 1981 when it was ended due to a dispute over the content of one of North's articles. Following the dispute, North and Chalcedon continued to independently promote each other's views, but they did not reach a \"truce\" until 1995.<ref name= \"Davis-Hankins\" />\n\nUnder Rushdoony, the Chalcedon Foundation grew to twelve staff members with 25,000–40,000 people on their mailing lists during the 1980s.

Rushdoony's son, the Rev. Mark R Rushdoony, became and remains the president of the Chalcedon Foundation and editor of the ''Chalcedon Report''.<ref name = \"RIP\" />\n\n== Philosophical and theological contributions ==\nMichael J. McVicar summarized Rushdoony's theology and philosophy as follows:<ref name=\":0\" />{{Bq|text = As a theologian Rushdoony saw human beings as primarily religious creatures bound to God, not as rational autonomous thinkers. While this may seem an esoteric theological point, it isn't. All of Rushdoony's influence on the Christian Right stems from this single, essential fact. Many critics of Christian Reconstructionism assume that Rushdoony's unique contribution to the Christian Right was his focus on theocracy. In fact, Rushdoony's primary innovation was his single-minded effort to popularize a pre-Enlightenment, medieval view of a God-centered world. By de-emphasizing humanity's ability to reason independently of God, Rushdoony attacked the assumptions most of us uncritically accept.}}\n\nRushdoony developed his philosophy as an extension of the work of Calvinist philosopher [[Cornelius Van Til]]. Van Til critiqued human knowledge in light of the Calvinist doctrine of [[total depravity]]. He argued that sin affected a person's ability to reason. In order to be rational, Van Til claimed, one must presuppose the existence of God and the [[Bible, Inerrancy and Infallibility of|inerrant]], divine [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of the (Protestant) [[Protestant Bible|Bible]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Rushdoony attended to the implications&nbsp;–&nbsp;where Van Til held true knowledge came from God, Rushdoony asserted that \"all non-Christian knowledge is sinful, invalid nonsense. The only valid knowledge that non-Christians possess is 'stolen' from 'Christian-theistic' sources.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In effect, Rushdoony extended Van Til's thinking from philosophy to \"all of life and thought.\"<ref name=\"bcse\" />\n\n=== Early writings ===\nRushdoony began popularizing, albeit densely, the works of Calvinist philosophers Cornelius Van Til and [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] into a short survey of contemporary [[humanism]] called ''By What Standard?''. Arguing for a Calvinist system of thought, Rushdoony dealt with subjects as broad as [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of mind|cognitive metaphysics]] and as narrow as the [[psychology of religion]] and [[predestination]]. He wrote a book, ''The One And The Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy'', using Van Tillian [[Presuppositional apologetics|presuppositional philosophy]] to critique various aspects of [[secular humanism]]. He also wrote many essays and book reviews, published in such venues as the ''[[Westminster Theological Journal]]''.\n\n=== Homeschooling ===\nRushdoony's next focus was on education, especially on behalf of [[homeschooling]], which he saw as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system. By the early 1960s he was active in the homeschooling movement, appearing as an [[expert witness]] in order to defend the rights of homeschoolers.<ref name=\"Edgar\"/>He vigorously attacked [[progressivism|progressive]] [[school reform]]ers such as [[Horace Mann]] and [[John Dewey]] and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence on education in three works: ''Intellectual Schizophrenia'' (a general and concise study of education), ''The Messianic Character of American Education'' (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and ''The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum'' (a parent-oriented pedagogical statement).\n\n=== History ===\nRushdoony then pursued history – of the world, of the United States, and of the church. He maintained that Calvinistic Christianity provided the intellectual roots for the [[American Revolution]] and thus had always had an influential impact in [[History of the United States|American history]]. The American Revolution, according to Rushdoony, was a \"conservative counterrevolution\" to preserve American liberties from British usurpation and it owed nothing to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  He further argued that the [[United States Constitution]] was a secular document in appearance only; it didn't need to establish Christianity as an official religion since the states were already Christian establishments.<ref name=\"Edgar\"/> Drawing on the work of theologian [[Robert Lewis Dabney]], Rushdoony argued that the [[American Civil War]] \"destroyed the early American Republic, which he envisioned as a decentralized Protestant [[feudal system]] and an orthodox Christian nation\". Rushdoony\nsaw the North's victory as a \"defeat for Christian orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"nc\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = University of Texas Press\n| isbn = 9780292779211\n| chapter = The US Civil War as a Theological War: Neo-Confederacy, Christian Nationalism and Theology\n| last = Sebesta\n| first = Edward H. \n| last2 = Hague\n| first2 = Euan\n| title = Neo-Confederacy: A Critical Introduction\n| editor-last = Hague\n| editor-first = Euan\n| editor-last2 = Beirich \n| editor-first2 = Heidi\n| editor-last3 = Sebesta\n| editor-first3 = Edward H. \n| pages=57–58, 67\n| date = 2009-09-15\n\n}}</ref>\nSome historians have argued that this aspect of Rushdoony's thought influenced some activists in the\n[[Neo-Confederate]] movement<ref name=\"nc\" /> and Southern conservatives such as [[J.

With a title modeled after [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', Rushdoony's ''Institutes'' was arguably his most influential work. In the book, he proposed that [[Old Testament]] law should be applied to modern [[society]] and that there should be a Christian [[theonomy]], a concept developed in his colleague [[Greg Bahnsen]]'s controversial book ''Theonomy in Christian Ethics,'' which Rushdoony heartily endorsed. In the ''Institutes'', Rushdoony supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include [[homosexuality]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], lying about one's [[virginity]], [[bestiality]], [[witchcraft]], [[idolatry]] or [[apostasy]], public [[blasphemy]], false prophesying, [[kidnapping]], [[rape]], and bearing false witness in a capital case.<ref name=\"Durand\">{{cite book|year=2014|last=Durand|first=Greg Loren|url=http://crownrights.com/store/reconstruction.php|title=Judicial Warfare: Christian Reconstruction and Its Blueprints for Dominion|edition=3rd|isbn=978-1495486111|publisher=Crown Rights Book Co.|location=Toccoa, Georgia|pp=99–112|ref=harv}}</ref> Although he supported the [[separation of church and state]] at the national level, Rushdoony also believed that both institutions were under the rule of [[God]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Gore|first=Liz|url=http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9607/rushdoony.html|title=R.J.
