He organised and coordinated the ''[[SOE F Section networks#Chestnut|Chestnut]]'' network. He was captured and executed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].\n\n==Personal and early life==\nGrover-Williams was born in [[Montrouge]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], France, on 16 January 1903 to Frederick and Hermance Grover. Frederick Grover was an English [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] who had settled in Montrouge. Frederick met a French girl, Hermance Dagan, and they were soon married. Their first child was Elizabeth, born in 1897. William had two other siblings – Alice and Frederic.<ref name=\"family\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=27}}</ref> Born to an English father and a French mother, Grover-Williams grew up fluent in both the French and English languages.\n\nWhen William was eleven, he was sent to live with relatives in [[Hertfordshire]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. After the war, Frederick Grover moved the family to [[Monte Carlo]]. It was there that William developed a fascination for automobiles, having been taught to drive a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] by his sister's boyfriend. Grover-Williams passed his [[driving test]] whilst in [[Monaco]] and was granted a [[Driver's license|licence]].<ref name=\"england_montecarlo\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=28}}</ref> Mechanically inclined, and fascinated by motorised vehicles, at the age of 15, Grover-Williams acquired an [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycle and it became his pride and joy.<ref name=\"p29\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=29}}</ref> He would later go on to compete in motorcycle races in the early 1920s, although he kept it secret from his family by adopting the pseudonym, \"W Williams\".<ref name=\"motorcycle_racing\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1919, the [[Ireland|Irish]] portrait painter, [[William Orpen]] became the official artist of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Orpen bought a Rolls-Royce car and hired Grover-Williams, who had returned to Paris, as his [[chauffeur]].<ref name=\"p29\" /> At the time, Orpen had a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] named [[Yvonne Aupicq]].<ref>Sometimes spelled Aubicque, see https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/7691212/The-WWI-copy-thats-worth-250000.html</ref> Aupicq and Grover-Williams became good friends and, after the collapse of Aupicq's relationship with Orpen, the pair were married in November 1929.<ref name=\"p32\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=32}}</ref><ref name=\"p39\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=39}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:William Grover-Williams at the 1929 French Grand Prix (5).jpg|250px|thumb|right|William Grover-Williams in 1929 Le Mans, Grand Prix A.C.F. driving Bugatti Type 35]]\nBy 1926, Grover-Williams had begun racing a [[Bugatti]] in races throughout France, using the alias, \"W Williams\",<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite book\n | last = Higham\n | first = Peter\n | title = The Guinness Guide to International Motor Racing\n | publisher = Guinness Publishing\n | year = 1995\n | pages = 200–208, 542\n | isbn = 0-85112-642-1}}\n</ref> entering the ''Grand Prix de Provence'' at [[Circuit of Miramas|Miramas]] and the [[Monte Carlo Rally]].

In 1931, he won the [[Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Spa-Francorchamps]].<ref name=\"guinness\"/> He also won the [[Grand Prix de la Baule]] in three consecutive years (1931 to 1933).

Due to his fluency in French and English, he was recruited into the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to foster the [[French Resistance]]. He recruited fellow racing driver [[Robert Benoist]] and together they worked in the [[Paris]] region to build up a successful circuit of operatives, forming sabotage cells and reception committees for Allied parachute operations.\n\nOn 2 August 1943,<ref name=\"guinness\"/> Grover-Williams was arrested by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' and underwent lengthy interrogation before being deported to Berlin and was then held prisoner in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].\n\n==Death==\nGrover-Williams was executed at Sachsenhausen in the spring of 1945, along with fellow SOE network leader [[Francis Suttill]].<ref name=\"Death\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=317–318}}</ref><ref>[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns18854.html \"One of motor racing's greatest mysteries is solved\"], MARCH 7 2007, grandprix.com</ref>\n\nThere is a theory that Grover-Williams survived the war, and lived on under an assumed identity as \"Georges Tambal\" who allegedly lived with Grover-Williams's widow for many years, but there is no evidence for this whatsoever.<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/sport/formula-one-uncovering-the-mystery-of-william-grover-williams-1-2321005 \"Formula One: Uncovering the mystery of William Grover-Williams\"], Richard Bath, Sunday 27 May 2012, The Scotsman on Sunday</ref><ref>[http://8w.forix.com/rb-w-jpw.html \"A different danger – three champions at war\"], Richard Armstrong, 12 May 2002, forix.com</ref>\n\n==Legacy and recognition==\nGrover-Williams is recorded on the [[Brookwood Memorial]] in [[Surrey]], England,<ref name=\"brookwood_memorial\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2146381 |title=Casualty Details: GROVER-WILLIAMS, WILLIAM CHARLES FREDERICK |accessdate=4 January 2009 |work=[http://www.cwgc.org/default.asp Commonwealth War Graves Commission]}}</ref> and as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, he is listed on the [[Valençay SOE Memorial]]'s ''Roll of Honour'' in the French town of [[Valençay]].\n\nGrover-Williams was recommended for an [[Order of the British Empire]] by the head of the SOE, [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Colin Gubbins]], in September 1945, but when it became clear that he had died the honour was not awarded.<ref name=\"MBE_recommendation\">{{cite book |last=Saward |authorlink=Joe Saward|title=The Grand Prix Saboteurs|pages=343}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Saboteur (2009 video game)|The Saboteur]]'', a video game released in 2009, features an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[protagonist]] named Sean Devlin who is inspired by Grover-Williams.<ref name=\"ign\">{{Cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/779/779284p1.html |title=Saboteur Interview |accessdate=12 January 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher= |date=9 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502055018/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/779/779284p1.html |archivedate=2 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Results and records==\n\n===Grand Prix wins===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Grand Prix\n!Location\n!Car\n!Report\n|-\n|align=center|[[1928 Grand Prix season|1928]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[French Grand Prix]]\n|[[Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne|Saint-Gaudens]]\n|[[Bugatti Type 35]]\n|[[1928 French Grand Prix|Report]]\n|-\n|align=center rowspan=2|[[1929 Grand Prix season|1929]]\n|{{flagicon|MON}} [[Monaco Grand Prix]]\n|[[Circuit de Monaco|Monte Carlo]]\n|Bugatti Type 35\n|[[1929 Monaco Grand Prix|Report]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} French Grand Prix\n|[[Circuit des 24 Heures|Le Mans]]\n|Bugatti Type 35\n|[[1929 French Grand Prix|Report]]\n|-\n|align=center rowspan=2|[[1931 Grand Prix season|1931]]\n|{{flagicon|BEL}} [[Belgian Grand Prix]] †\n|[[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]]\n|[[Bugatti Type 51]]\n|[[1931 Belgian Grand Prix|Report]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Grand Prix de la Baule]]\n|[[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]]\n|Bugatti Type 51\n|[[1931 Grand Prix de la Baule|Report]]\n|-\n|align=center|[[1932 Grand Prix season|1932]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Grand Prix de la Baule\n|La Baule\n|Bugatti Type 51\n|[[1932 Grand Prix de la Baule|Report]]\n|-\n|align=center|[[1933 Grand Prix season|1933]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Grand Prix de la Baule\n|La Baule\n|[[Bugatti Type 54]]\n|[[1933 Grand Prix de la Baule|Report]]\n|}\n† Grover-Williams shared a car with [[Caberto Conelli]].\n\n===Complete European Championship results===\n([[:Template:EC driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n!
