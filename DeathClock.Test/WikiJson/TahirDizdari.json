Dizdari family traces their origin from a military who had settled in Shkodër from [[İznik]] of the [[Province of Bursa]], today's [[Turkey]].<ref>{{citation| author=Hamdi Bushati| title=Shkodra dhe motet |trans-title=Shkoder and epochs|volume=II | page=292 |location=[[Shkodër]]| year= 1999| publisher=Idromeno | oclc=41096394}}</ref> Dizdari finished his early education in the [[Turkish language]] school of his town, following later the ''Ruzdiye'' (mmiddle school) which he couldn't finish due to the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]]. He registered later in the [[Saverian College of Shkodër]], finishing it in 1918.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/> He focused on the Oriental languages and on mastering the [[French language]]. At a young age, he started working in the Albanian public administration, holding various positions in [[Vlorë]], [[Durrës]], and [[Pukë]]. One of his contributions during this time was the draft-statute ''Ligja e katundarive dhe e komunave'' (Law of villages and municipalities), being a main contributor of a work that targeted the formation, structuration, and operation of the local government, first of its kind within the newly created Albanian state of that time. In 1935, he published the manual ''Udhëhjekës për konferenca'' (Guide to conferences). He was also involved in huge projects, i.e. the general registration of the population in 1930.<ref name=\"KMSH\"/>\n\nAs a monarchist and supporter of [[Zog I of Albania|King Zog I of Albania]], Dizdari participated in the armed resistance against the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] of April 1939. Due to his known pro-monarchy stance and his involvement in the skirmishes against the Italians at Gomsiqe near Pukë, he would be arrested and interned by the Italians.\n<br>With the [[Albania under Germany|German occupation of Albania]], he resumed his research on orientalism and writing in the local Albanian press. During 1944, he wrote a separate column \"Pyes vetveten\" (I ask myself) in the ''Bashkimi i kombit'' (Nation's unity) newspaper, which would continue later in the ''[[Bashkimi (Democratic Front newspaper)|Bashkimi]]'' (Unity) during 1945-1946, using the pen-name \"Hijekakeqi\". During 1944, still in the newspaper ''Bashkimi i kombit'', he contributed to the [[linguistics]] section \"Fjalë iranishte në gjuhën shqipe\" (Iranian words in the Albanian language) using the pen-name \"Bishtiqindija\". He also published two [[toponymy]] studies: ''[[Skadarska Krajina|Kraja]]'' in the ''Bashkimi i kombit'' and ''Katër Balët'' (Four Balas) in the ''Bota e re'' (New world) magazine. He wrote also satirical articles, and religion-oriented articles in the ''Kultura islame'' (Islamic culture) and ''Bleta'' (Honeybee) magazines.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>\n<br>In May 1945 he was affiliated with the ''Bashkimi'' newspaper of the [[Democratic Front of Albania|Democratic Front]], and in October 1945 acquired membership in the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]]. During 1946-1951, he focused on studying the Albanian dictionary and folklore, submitting a work of around 800 pages to the [[Institute of Folklore of Albania|Institute of Folklore]].<ref name=\"KMSH\"/>\n\nIn February 1951, he got arrested and interrogated for several months due to an alleged connection with the so-called [[Massacre of 1951 in Albania|bombing of the Soviet embassy in Tirana]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tijBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&dq=tahir+dizdari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9xY7by5HKAhWM5CYKHS_5BhAQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&q=tahir%20dizdari&f=false The Bomb and the Soviet Embassy in Tirana - Uran Butka]</ref> but was set free since there was no incriminating evidence against him. Nevertheless, this affected his position within the Communist society, and his relations with the scholar environment. This also marked probably the most critical moment in his life, his family would be expelled from Tirana. In 1952, he opened a small bookstore which served him for lodging as well. Due to his knowledge of oriental languages, parts of the \"oriental words dictionary\" (which would be his most notable work later) were published in the ''Buletinin USHT (seria shkencave shoqërore)'' (Bulletin of the University of Tirana: social sciences series) of early [['60s]], and later the ''[[Studime filologjike]]'' (Philological studies) during 1964-1966. He also took part and gave speeches in three conferences on [[albanology]], held in Tirana in 1962, 1968, and 1969. The [[Institute of Linguistics of Albania|Institute of Linguistics]] ({{lang-sq|Instituti i Gjuhësisë}}), despite the previous political obstacles, decided to engage him as \"senior scientific cooperator\" ({{lang-sq|Bashkëpunëtor i vjetër shkencor}}), affiliated with its [[lexicology]] section, from 1965 till 9 May 1972, when Dizdari died.<ref name=\"KMSH\"/>\n\nHis main work out of his active period 1941-1971 are the ''Orientalizmat në gjuhën shqipe'' (Orientalisms within the Albanian language), and ''Fjalë të pambledhura nga fjalorët e deritanishëm'' (Words not collected in the previous dictionaries), the last one being an important work on the Albanian language dictionary enrichment with \"old\" or obsolete words not collected until then.<ref name=\"KMSH\"/> Both were handed over to the Institute of Linguistics and were published later.<ref name=\"Elsie\">{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&pg=PA116&dq=tahir+dizdari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjg6GD0ZHKAhVCWCYKHUB7AgUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=tahir%20dizdari&f=false| author=Robert Elsie|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History| page=116 | year=2012| publisher=I.B.Tauris| isbn=9781780764313}}</ref>\n<br>The ''Fjalor i orientalizmave në gjuhën shqipe'' (Dictionary of orientalisms within the Albanian language), a volumiunous work of around 1200 pages, was published in 2005.<ref>{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoVpAAAAMAAJ&q=tahir+dizdari&dq=tahir+dizdari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9xY7by5HKAhWM5CYKHS_5BhAQ6AEISTAI| page=155| journal=[[Studia Albanica]]| publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of Albania]]| volume=39| year=2006| issn= 0585-5047|oclc= 1996482| title=Critique et bibliographie}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nBase on a proposal by the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania|Academy of Sciences]], the [[President of Albania]] [[Sali Berisha]] awarded him the order \"Naim Frashëri\" of 1-st Class in 1995, with the dedication \"For valuable contribution in the development of Albanological studies\".<ref name=\"KMSH\">{{citation| url=http://www.kmsh.al/al/2013/07/tahir-dizdari/| publisher=Muslim Community of Albania| language=Albanian| title=Tahir Dizdari| accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n'''Notes'''\n*{{cnote|a|Elsie places date of death on May 6th 1972<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>}}\n'''References'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dizdari, Tahir}}\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Shkodër]]\n[[Category:Albanian orientalists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Albanian people]]\n[[Category:Albanian monarchists]]\n[[Category:Albanian scholars]]\n[[Category:Albanian folklorists]]\n[[Category:Albanian civil servants]]\n[[Category:Albanian Sunni Muslims]]\n[[Category:People from Scutari Vilayet]]\n[[Category:Albanian journalists]]\n[[Category:Linguists from Albania]]\n[[Category:Albanologists]]"
