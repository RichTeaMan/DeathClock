He was also Bengal's most famous practitioner of [[Bengali science fiction|science fiction]] in its own language. His critique of humanity led him to believe that for it to survive, human beings had to \"forget their differences and be united\".<ref>Bridges to Breakthroughs: Tracing the Genealogy of the Indian Science. Shradha Kabra, The Criterion, an International Journal in English, December 2012, Vol.III, Iss.IV, {{ISSN|0976-8165}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHe was born in [[Varanasi]], India where his father Gyanendranath Mitra was an employee of the [[Indian Railways]] and because of that he had the opportunity to travel to many places in India. Having lost his mother, who died during his childhood, he was brought up by his grandparents in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and spent his later life in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) and [[Dhaka]]. He was a student of [[South Suburban School (Main)]] and enrolled for a BA at the [[Scottish Church College]]<ref>''Some Alumni of Scottish Church College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 590</ref> in Calcutta which he left prematurely to study agriculture in [[Santiniketan]] with a friend of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Leonard Elmhirst]]. Because it did not hold his interest, he returned to education first on an undergraduate course in Dhaka and in 1925 at [[Asutosh College]] in Calcutta where he assisted the research of [[Dinesh Chandra Sen]].<ref>Premendra Mitra Mindscape (Bengali), Sahitya Akademi, 2000</ref>\n\nDuring his initial years, he (unsuccessfully) aspired to be a physician and studied the [[natural sciences]]. Later he started out as a school teacher. He even tried to make a career for himself as a businessman, but he was unsuccessful in that venture as well. At a time, he was working in the marketing division of a medicine producing company. After trying out other occupations, in which he met marginal or moderate success, he rediscovered his talents for creativity in writing and eventually became a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] author and poet.\n\nMarried to Beena Mitra in 1930, he was, by profession, a professor of Bengali at [[City College, Calcutta|City College]] in north Calcutta. He spent almost his entire life in a house at [[Kalighat]], Calcutta.\n\n==As an author and editor==\nIn November 1923, Mitra came from Dhaka and stayed in a mess at Gobinda Ghoshal Lane, Calcutta. There, he wrote 2 stories and sent them to the popular Bengali journal ''[[Prabasi]]'' (meaning: ''The Exile''). His first published work was ''Shudhu Keranee'' in ''[[Prabasi]]'' in March 1924. In the following issue, another story, ''Goponcharini'', was published. His poems were better known for their sharpness and wit. They also expressed [[empathy]] for the sufferings of the [[proletariat]]. Five years earlier, in 1925, when [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote ''Punoshcho'', the first universally accepted [[Bengali language|Bengali]] prose-poetry book, Mitra wrote some poetries in the magazines, ''Bijli'', ''[[Kali Kalam]]'', etc. which were of that kind. [[Buddhadeb Bosu]] thus wrote:\n{{quote| He is one of the earliest practitioners— one might say pioneers— of the prose poem.}}\n\nThe first book of poetry was ''Prothoma'' (1932).\n\nHis short stories were well-structured and innovative, and encompassed the diverse to the divergent in urban Indian society. The themes of poverty, [[wikt:degradation|degradation]], [[caste]], the intermittent conflict between religion and [[rationality]] and themes of the rural-urban divide are a thematically occurring refrain in much of his work. He experimented with the stylistic nuances of Bengali prose and tried to offer alternative linguistic parameters to the high-class elite prose of the Bengali language. It was basically an effort to make the [[Bengali literature]] free from softness, excessive romance and use of an old style of writing which were prevalent in contemporary writings. ''Nana Range Bona'' is not only a short story collection, but it is the only known autobiography of Premendra Mitra. He edited Bengali journals and news-magazines like ''[[Kallol]]'' [কল্লোল], ''[[Kali Kalam]]'' [কালি কলম], ''[[Banglar Kotha]]'', ''[[Bongobani]]'' etc. He also wrote in ''[[Mouchak]]'', a magazine run by [[Sudhir Chandra Sarkar]].\nHe was connected to the [[Akashbani]] at first as a producer; later he performed other duties.\n\nHe also wrote brilliant and innovative science fictions and thrillers. Those are based on firm scientific temperaments and facts. Two of his most well-known stories are ''[[Piprey Puran]]'' (The Story of the Ants) and ''[[Mangalbairi]]'' [মঙ্গলবৈরী] (The Martian Enemies). Although these are more popular among Bengali-speaking school children and teenagers, they are popular among an older generation of literary aficionados as well.\n\n===Ghanada===\n{{See also|Premendra Mitra#Characters|l1=Characters}}\n\nIn particular, his creation of the character of [[Ghanada]] [ঘনাদা] (meaning: 'Elder brother Ghana' in Bengali) won him public recognition.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Sahitya Akademi, 1992</ref> The character of Ghanada is an uninterested unemployed middle-aged male who can apparently weave adventures almost at the drop of a hat. His adventures cover themes ranging from crime, human ingenuity, science, history, geography, metaphysics and philosophy. It is obvious that while Ghanada himself has not been involved in any of the adventures he claims to have taken part in, he is certainly a learned man with an exceptional gift for storytelling. The stories are notably accurate from a scientific point of view. Ghanada may be seen as Mitra's parody or caricature of the Bengali urban middle class celibate intellectual, who is at home in the world of books and knowledge, but has little practical experience whatsoever. It is also interesting to note that like [[Satyajit Ray]]'s [[Feluda]], the older Ghanada although not abhorring the opposite sex, is not entirely at ease with them either. He stays at an all-male hostel and maintains an almost frugal existence. Ghanada is a self-educated person and his education is mostly due to time spent at the local libraries. In a way, it could be argued that these stories also reflect larger patterns of social transformations.\n\n<!--The '''''Ghanada Gallery''''' website displays the original illustrations accompanying the Ghanada tales, as they appeared in the Puja annuals and first-edition books, along with other Ghanada memorabilia : http://ghanada.wix.com/ghanada-gallery-->\n\n===Mejokorta===\n{{See also|Premendra Mitra#Characters|l1=Characters}}\nAnother masterpice of his creation was the character of ''[[Mejokorta]]'' (meaning: 'the next brother of the eldest son of a family' in Bengali). [[Mejokarta]] was a famous \"''Bhoot Shikari''\" (meaning: Ghost-hunter in Bengali). The series of Mejokarta, although not as long as that of Ghanada, has left its prominent mark in the genre of ghost stories in Bengali.\n\nMitra's literary works were included in the curriculum at school level, secondary, higher secondary and graduation levels of  [[Bengali literature]] in [[West Bengal]] and Bangladesh.\n\n===List of books===\n----\n\n====Poems====\n*''Prothoma'' (First Lady)\n*''Somrat'' (The Emperor)\n*''Feraari Fouj''  (The Lost Army) Poetries:''Phyan'' [ফ্যান]\n*''Sagor Theke Fera'' (Returning From The Sea)\n*''Horin Cheeta Chil'' (Deer, Cheetah, Kite) Poetries: ''Khunt'' [খুঁত] (Wrong)\n*''Kokhono Megh'' (An Occasional Cloud)\n*''Ananya'' (One-of-a-kind, Unique)\n*''Khuda wahid'' (Allah)\n\n====Short story collections====\n\n=====Bengali=====\n*''PonchoShor'' [পঞ্চশর] (The Five Arrows)\n*''Benami Bandar'' [বেনামি বন্দর] (Unknown Harbour)\n*''Putul O Protima'' [পুতুল ও প্রতিমা] (Doll And Clay Image of Goddess)\n*''Mrittika'' [মৃত্তিকা] (Earthen image)\n*''Ofuronto'' [অফুরন্ত] (Endless)\n*''Dhuli Dhusor'' [ধূলি ধূসর] (Fade As Dust)\n*''Mohanagar'' [মহানগর] (The Great City)\n*''Jol Payra'' (Water Pigeon)\n*''Sreshto Golpo'' [শ্রেষ্ঠ গল্প] (Best Stories)\n*''Nana Ronge Bona'' [নানা রঙে বোনা] (Knit with Different Colours)\n*''Nirbachita'' [নির্বাচিত] (Selected)\n\n=====English=====\n(Not actually written by him, later translated)\n*''Snake And Other Stories''\n*''Mosquito and Other Stories''\n*''Adventures of Ghanada''\n\n=====For children=====\n*''MayurPankhi'' [ময়ূরপঙ্খী]\n*''SagorDanri'' [সাগরদাঁড়ি]\n*''MakorMukhi'' [মকরমুখী]\n.\n\n===List of writings===\n----\n\n====Rhymes====\n*''Hariye'' [হারিয়ে]\n*''Borong'' [বরং]\n*''Misti Megh'' [মিষ্টি মেঘ] (A Sweet Cloud)\n*''Onko'' [অঙ্ক] (Mathematics)\n*''Misti'' [মিষ্টি] (Sweet)\n*''Duti Banshi'' [দুটি বাঁশি] (The Two Flutes)\n*''Megher Ghurhi'' [মেঘের ঘুড়ি] (The Kite of Cloud)\n\n====Fairy tales, ghost stories and teenager stories====\n*''Chorui Pakhira Kothay Jay'' [চড়ুই পাখিরা কোথায় যায়]\n*''Lighthouse-e'' [লাইটহাউসে] (At the Lighthouse)\n*''Satyabadi Suku'' [সত্যবাদী সুকু] (Suku the Truth Speaker)\n*''Hatir Danter Kaj'' [হাতির দাঁতের কাজ] (Work Done By the Tooth of an Elephant)\n*''Golper Swarge'' [গল্পের স্বর্গে] (At the Paradise of Stories)\n*''Putuler Lorai'' [পুতুলের লড়াই] (The Fight of the Dolls)\n*''Ramrajye Bidroha'' [রামরাজ্যে বিদ্রোহ]\n*''Kurukshetre Bhaja Orfe Brihaddhaja'' [কুরুক্ষেত্রে ভজা ওরফে বৄহদ্ধজ] (Bhaja Alias Brihaddhaja at the Kurukshetra)\n*''Ratan Panjali'' [রতন পাঞ্জালী]\n*''Ko-Aai'' [কো-আই]\n*''Porira Keno Ase Na'' [পরিরা কেন আসে না] (Why the Fairies Don’t Come)\n*''KalRakkhos Kothay Thake?
