Purdue University Press. 2009. p. 177</ref>\n\n== Life and career ==\nGorgolewski was born in [[Solec Kujawski|Solec (Schulitz)]], [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Between 1866 and 1871 he studied in [[Berlin]] at the [[Bauakademie|Royal Building Academy]]. During his studies, Gorgolewski also supervised the construction of Hanover Train Station in Berlin. After graduating, for six years he worked as an assistant in his alma mater. After that he became an advisor at the German Ministry of Public Works, official royal palace architect and architecture inspector in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]].<ref name=\"Stanski\">{{pl icon}} [http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/gorgolewski.html Piotr Marek Stański - ''Zygmunt Gorgolewski, twórca gmachu Lwowskiego Teatru Wielkiego'']</ref> Gorgolewski was one of the most notable supporters of historicism in architecture in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and then the [[German Empire]]. \n\nAmong his projects were two versions of the future [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building, which he proposed in 1872 and then in 1882. His projects were among merely 20 chosen by the committee out of more than 100. However, in the end his ideas for these projects were refused.<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> At the same time, Gorgolewski was awarded with the construction of Kaiser Wilhelm's Bridge. Other, more successful, projects include the plans of refurbishment of royal palaces in Berlin and [[Kiel]], expansion of University Hospitals in Halle and [[Bonn]], expansion of [[Bad Oeynhausen]] spa in [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]]. In addition, he was the main architect of the Protestant cathedral in Berlin, [[Belle Vue (Palace)|Belle Vue]] palace, courthouses in [[Opole|Opole (Oppeln)]] and [[Olsztyn|Olsztyn (Allenstein)]], as well as prisons in [[Świdnica|Świdnica (Schweidnitz)]] and [[Chorzów|Chorzów (Königshütte)]]. \n\nIn the [[Greater Poland]] region, Gorgolewski conducted the construction of many notable palaces both in and around [[Poznań]]. His works include:<ref name=\"Stanski\"/>\n* refurbishment of a church in [[Września]]\n* refurbishment of [[Działyński]] family palace in [[Gołuchów, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Gołuchów]]\n* refurbishment of [[Działyński]] family library in [[Kórnik]]\n* construction of [[Twardowski]] family palace in [[Kobylniki, Szamotuły County|Kobylniki]]<ref>Krystyna Siemiatycka.

[http://kobylniki.pl/index_ang.php?go=historia The History of the Palace in Kobylniki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162410/http://kobylniki.pl/index_ang.php?go=historia |date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n* enlargement of [[Kwilecki]] palace in [[Oporów]]\n* [[Radziwill|Radziwiłł]] family romantic castle ''Bagatela'' near [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]]\n* construction of a new church tower as well as a [[Czapski]] family chapel in Smogulec\n* construction of the headquarters of the [[Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences]] (1874–79), as well as houses in Berlińska street in front of it.\n\nHe was also appointed as the main architect of the refurbishment of the palace of [[Ferdynand Radziwiłł]] in [[Ołyka]], [[Volhynia]]. During his stay there, Gorgolewski for the first time visited [[Vilnius]], [[Kraków]], [[Kiev]] and [[Lviv]].<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> The latter city enjoyed a period of fast expansion and in 1875 Gorgolewski took part in the contest for the project of the future [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] [[Sejm]]. His project was the most disputed and highly praised, but it was finally turned down, mostly due to financial reasons. \n\nIn 1879, Gorgolewski married Helena ''née'' Hulewicz. He was also an active member of many architectural juries across partitioned Poland. Among others, he was the member of the jury during the contest for the project of [[Teatr Stary|Kraków Old Theatre]] (1889), the bank in [[Czerniowce]] and St. Elisabeth's Church in [[Lviv]]. In 1893 he moved to Lviv, where he was chosen as the main architect of the Grand Theatre (1897–1900). To avoid being accused of using his well-established position in society, Gorgolewski prepared his winning project of the theatre in secret<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> and then sent it under a [[Pseudonym|false name]] from [[Leipzig]]. Other notable building of his authorship was the Industrial School in the same city.\n\nGorgolewski died in Lwów and was buried in the [[Cmentarz lyczakowski|Łyczaków Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Stanski\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gorgolewski, Zygmunt}}\n[[Category:1845 births]]\n[[Category:1903 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Solec Kujawski]]\n[[Category:Polish architects]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Posen]]\n[[Category:Architects from Lviv]]\n[[Category:Burials at Lychakiv Cemetery]]"
