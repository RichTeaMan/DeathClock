Upon her father's death in 1938, she also inherited his estate, including the Triangle Ranch and more oil interests, and her wealth increased considerably.<ref name=\"nationalcowgirl\"/>\n\nShe became a renowned breeder of [[American Quarter Horse]]s.<ref name=\"nationalcowgirl\"/> She purchased [[Grey Badger I]] in 1949 and kept [[Streakin Six]], [[Dash For Cash]], and [[Special Effort]] at her 6666 Ranch.<ref name=\"texashorse\"/>\n\nShe served on the Board of Directors of the [[First National Bank of Fort Worth]], the [[Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show|Southwestern Exposition and Fat Stock Show]], and was on the board of trustees of Texas Christian University.

Waggoner was not a faithful husband; one day she drove away, smashing through all the gates instead of opening them, and left the car running at the train station.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cartwright |first=Gary |title=Showdown at Waggoner Ranch |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/showdown-at-waggoner-ranch |newspaper=Texas Monthly |date=January 2004}}</ref> Her second marriage was to [[James Goodwin Hall]] in 1932. They married in New York City at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. They had a daughter, [[Anne Windfohr Marion|Anne Burnett]], born in November 1938. They resided in a home on Spanish Trail in Westover Hills, designed by [[John F. Staub]]. The home underwent significant renovations in the early 1950s, with a modern entertaining pavillion and games room designed and decorated by [[William Haines]] and [[Melanie Kahane]]. \n\nAfter they divorced, she married Robert Frairy Windfohr in 1938, who died in 1964. Her mother Ollie Lake Burnett died in 1966.<ref name=\"texasstate\"/>\n\nIn 1944 she purchased the President [[Vargas diamond]] ring from [[Harry Winston]] for $420,000. The 48-carat emerald-cut ring was so heavy she couldn't lift her hand while wearing it. It was sold back to Winston in 1958.\n\nIn 1949 they commissioned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] to design a new house on a site in Westover Hills. Named Crownfield, the modernist design included a single level of circular-shaped and domed structures with a gold ceiling in the living room. Wright's unwillingness to include air-conditioning was one reason why the plans never came to fruition.\n\nIn 1969, she married [[Charles Tandy]], the founder of the [[Tandy Corporation]].<ref name=\"nationalcowgirl\"/>\n\nIn the early sixties she commissioned Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]] to design a new house in their site in Westover Hills in Fort Worth, the site of the dumped Crownfield project. Pei's dramatic 19,000 square-foot concrete and marble structure - which took two years to design and three years to build - was completed in 1969 and set a new standard in Dallas-Fort Worth for vanguard residential design, and became a local tourist attraction. It featured concrete walls bush-hammered to expose a quartz and pink feldspar aggregate. A raked skylighted shed-roof rising over a marble-floor entertainment area with bar gave the home its profile-identity. It was the first house Pei designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2015630665/|title=Acclaimed international architect I.M.
