He is credited with making the first [[artificial snow]]flakes.\n\n==Life and research==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Nakaya Ukichoro Museum of Snow and Ice.JPG|thumb|''Nakaya Ukichoro Museum of Snow and Ice'' (the hexagonal building, echoing the six-sided nature of snowflakes), at Katayamazu hot springs, [[Kaga, Ishikawa]], [[Japan]]]]\nNakaya was born near the Katayamazu [[onsen|hot springs]] in [[Kaga, Ishikawa|Kaga]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], near the area depicted in ''[[Hokuetsu Seppu]]'', an encyclopedic work published in 1837 that contains 183 sketches of natural snowflake crystals &ndash; the subject that became Nakaya's life work.\nNakaya later wrote that his father wanted him to be a [[pottery|potter]] and sent him to live with a potter while he was in [[primary school]]. His father died after he finished primary school, but\nNakaya's first [[scientific paper]], written in 1924 for the inaugural issue of the proceedings of the Physics Department of [[Tokyo Imperial University]], was devoted to Japanese [[Kutani ware|Kutani porcelain]].\n\nNakaya was inspired to study [[physics]] in high school by the [[Nebular hypothesis|nebular hypotheses]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] and by the works of [[Hajime Tanabe]].\nHe [[Academic major|major]]ed in [[experimental physics]] under [[Torahiko Terada]] at Tokyo Imperial University and graduated in 1925. Soon thereafter, he became Terada's research assistant at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research ([[RIKEN]]). Nakaya studied [[Electrostatic discharge#Sparks|electrostatic discharge]] as an assistant professor at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1928 and 1929, he continued his graduate studies at [[King's College London]] under [[Owen Willans Richardson]],<ref name=ArcticObituary>{{cite journal\n|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic15-3-242.pdf\n|title=Obituary, Ukichiro Nakaya\n|journal=Arctic |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Sep 1962 |pages=242–243\n|last=Bender |first=James A.\n|publisher=Arctic Institute of North America |doi=10.14430/arctic3579}}</ref> where he worked with long-wavelength [[X-ray]]s. In 1930, he became an assistant professor at [[Hokkaido University]], with which he would be associated for the rest of his life, and later that year he received his [[doctor of science]] degree from [[Kyoto Imperial University]].\n\nWhen he arrived at Hokkaido University, the physics department had a minimum of equipment and few research funds. But there was an unlimited supply of natural snow, so Nakaya began his research into snow crystals. From over 3,000 photomicrographs he established a general classification of natural snow crystals.<ref name=ArcticObituary/><ref name= Classifications>{{cite web\n|url=http://www1.odn.ne.jp/snow-crystals/page1_E.html\n|title=Snow Crystals in Hokkaido: Classification of snow crystals\n|last=Yanagi, |first=Satoshi\n|accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>\nIn 1935, he opened the Low Temperature Science Laboratory,<ref>[http://www.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/english/index.html Institute of Low Temperature Science website]</ref> and on March 12, 1936, created the first artificial snow crystal.\n\nFrom 1936 until 1938, Nakaya and his family lived at a hot springs resort on the [[Izu Peninsula]] while he recuperated from a bout of [[clonorchis sinensis|clonorchiasis]]. After his recovery, he began his studies of [[frost heaving]] which eventually led to the founding of the Laboratory of Agricultural Physics at Hokkaido University in 1946.<ref>[http://phys.agr.hokudai.ac.jp/index_e.html Laboratory of Agricultural Physics of Hokkaido University]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> In 1941, he received the [[Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy]] for his contributions to snow crystal research.\n\nIn 1943, two years after the [[Pacific War]] began, Nakaya moved to a newly built [[atmospheric icing]] observatory at Mt. Niseko-Annupuri,<ref>[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110005716778/ Icing Observatory at Mt. Niseko-Annupuri, Hokkaido]</ref> a 1,308 meter (4,290&nbsp;ft) mountain in Hokkaido. A [[A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter plane was brought to the observatory in the hope of finding ways to prevent [[atmospheric icing]]. The following year, Nakaya moved to the [[Nemuro Subprefecture|Nemuro]] [[coast]] to study artificial [[dissipation]] of [[fog]]. After the war, he continued his research for the Laboratory of Agricultural Physics into [[flood]] and [[snowmelt]] in [[drainage basin]]s.\n\nNakaya always enjoyed field work as well as laboratory research. His studies took him to locations ranging from the top of [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] to the ice island T-3 in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]].<ref name=ArcticObituary/> In 1949, on the invitation of the [[International Glaciological Society]] (an organization in which he later served as co-chairman), Nakaya toured the United States and Canada and attended the meeting establishing [[SIPRE]] ([[Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment]]).\nFrom 1952 until 1954, he was a research fellow at SIPRE. During this time, he lived in [[Winnetka, Illinois]] and studied Tyndall figures &ndash; melt figures that develop inside large crystals of glacial ice after exposure to bright sunlight, which were first described by the British physicist [[John Tyndall]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Living Ice: Understanding Glaciers and Glaciation\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|last=Sharp |first=Robert P.\n|year=1988\n|isbn=978-0-521-33009-1\n|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Tyndall Figures formed in Crystallographic Plane Perpendicular to [[Basal Plane]] of Ice Crystals\n|last=Higuchi |first=Keiji\n|journal=Nature |volume=202 |pages=485–487 |date=2 May 1964 |doi=10.1038/202485a0 |bibcode = 1964Natur.202..485H |issue=4931}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Harvard University Press published his ''Snow Crystals: Natural and Artificial'', an illustrated work that summarized his research on snowflake crystals, starting from his work at Hokkaido University. Though long out of print, it still serves as a classic reference on crystal shapes, showing how a scientific investigation can proceed through systematic observation toward an accurate description of a natural phenomenon.<ref name=ArcticObituary/><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/earlyobs/earlyobs.htm\n|title=Historic Snowflakes...early observations and studies of snow crystals\n|first=Kenneth G. |last=Libbrecht}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957 he visited [[Greenland]] as a member of the United States expedition for the [[International Geophysical Year]]. He visited Greenland several more times, usually staying for a month or two at a time, to observe the [[glaciology|glaciological]] [[ice cap]] at the [[78th parallel north|latitude 78°]] observatory site.\n\nIn 1960, Nakaya underwent surgery for [[prostate cancer]] at the hospital at the University of Tokyo. He died on April 11, 1962, of [[osteomyelitis]]. In recognition of his achievements, he was posthumously decorated with one of the highest [[Order (decoration)|order]]s awarded by the Japanese government.\n\nIn 1960, the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] named a group of [[Antarctic]] islands the \"[[Nakaya Islands]]\" in recognition of his contributions to science.<ref>{{cite web\n |title      = Nakaya Islands\n |url        = http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/mdms/cgi-bin/gazetteer.pl?pkey=31278\n |accessdate = 2009-03-06\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\nThe [[asteroid]] ''[[10152 Ukichiro]]'' is also named after him.\n\n==Snow crystals==\nFrom 1933, Nakaya observed natural snow and created 3,000 [[photographic plate]]s of snow crystals, classifying them into seven major and numerous minor types.<ref name= Classifications/> In the course of these observations, taking photographs of natural snow and sorting them by appearance according to weather conditions, Nakaya felt the need to make artificial snow from ice crystals grown in the laboratory. He generated [[water vapor]] in a dual-layer hollow glass tube, which was then cooled. Contrary to his initial expectations, creating snow crystals was not an easy task &ndash; instead of forming into snowflakes, the ice crystals grew like caterpillars on the cotton string he used for [[nucleation]].\n\nThe Low Temperature Science Laboratory opened in 1935, and experiments continued with various materials for the [[ice nucleus]]. These experiments revealed that woolen string is better than cotton string; however, the snow crystals were still not forming as intended. One day Nakaya found a snow crystal on the tip of a hair of a rabbit-fur coat in the lab. This was the breakthrough that led to the production of the first artificial snow crystal. On March 12, 1936, three years after the first attempt, he produced a snow crystal on the tip of a single hair of rabbit fur in his laboratory apparatus. In December 1937, he took photographs of many types of artificial snow crystals in his lab. These photographs were influenced by [[Wilson Bentley]]'s 1931 book ''Snow Crystals'', which he admired greatly.\n<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Nakaya |first=Ukichiro\n|date=1 December 1937\n|chapter={{nihongo|Miscellaneous notes on snow|雪雑記|Yuki zakki}}\n|title={{nihongo|Essays by Ukichiro Nakaya|中谷宇吉郎随筆集|Nakaya Ukichiro Zuihitushū}}\n|isbn=4-00-311241-5\n|page=22\n|edition=12th\n|publisher=Iwanami Shoten}}\n</ref>\n\nNakaya continued his research into snow crystals and elucidated how their various patterns are produced in nature. He published his ''Nakaya Diagram'', which describes the relationships among [[vapor]], [[temperature]], [[supersaturation]], and excess vapor density in clouds.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/ptdice/english/aletter.html\n|title=Fascination of Snow Crystals-How are their beautiful patterns created?\n|first=Yoshinori |last=Furukawa\n|publisher=Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University\n}}</ref>\n\nNakaya's achievement is commemorated today by a hexagonal stone monument at the site of his laboratory on the campus of [[Hokkaido University]].  His original apparatus is preserved and on display at The Institute for Low Temperature Science.\n\n==Essays on science==\n{{Rquote |right |... snow crystals may be called letters sent from heaven. |Ukichiro Nakaya |Snow Crystals (1939)}}\nNakaya was also a prolific science essayist. A select bibliography at the website of the Nakaya Ukichiro Museum of Snow and Ice lists more than 40 titles that explained science for the general public, on topics ranging from snow and [[geophysics]] to [[archaeology]] and the [[scientific method]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url       = http://www.city.kaga.ishikawa.jp/yuki/siryo/mokuroku.pdf\n |title     = Nakaya Ukichiro Select Bibliography\n |publisher = Nakaya Ukichiro Museum of Snow and Ice\n |language  = Japanese\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nHe also produced a number of documentary films and radio programs. In 1950, he played a central role in the founding of [[Iwanami Productions]], which went on to produce more than 4,000 documentary and educational films. (The films are now available from Hitachi Media Productions in digital form as the Iwanami Film Library.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.hitachi.co.jp/New/cnews/0002/0222a.html\n|title=Iwanami Film Library Established\n|publisher=Hitachi, Ltd. news release\n|date=2000-12-22\n|language=Japanese\n|accessdate=2009-03-06}}\n</ref>)\n\nHis most famous quote is probably \"Snowflakes are letters sent from heaven.\" He returned to this idea several times, first in his 1939 documentary film ''Snow Crystals'', and again in a handwritten note in a copy of his 1954 book ''Snow Crystals: Natural and Artificial''.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://www.city.kaga.ishikawa.jp/yuki/comm/pdf/kantushin/no12.pdf\n|title=Communications, Nakaya Uchikiro Museum of Snow and Ice\n|chapter=Snowflakes are letters...\n|volume=12\n|date=2005-03-31\n|page=3\n|language=Japanese}})</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nNakaya married twice. His first wife was the daughter of {{nihongo|Sakutaro Fujioka|[[:ja:藤岡作太郎|藤岡作太郎]]|Fujioka Sakutarō}}, a literary historian who taught at Tokyo Imperial University. She died in Japan of [[diphtheria]] while Nakaya was studying at King's College. He remarried in 1932.
