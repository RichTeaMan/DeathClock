Her father acceded to the throne on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936, from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|during the Second World War]], serving in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, she became [[Head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. She has reigned through major constitutional changes, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom]], Canadian [[patriation]], and the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of [[States headed by Queen Elizabeth II|her realms]] varied as territories gained independence and realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed [[Sri Lanka]]), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a [[Queen Elizabeth II's state visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation in 1953]] and the celebrations of her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]], and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilees]] in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a [[Sapphire Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Sapphire Jubilee]]. She is the [[List of British monarchs by longevity|longest-lived]] and [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning British monarch]] as well as the world's [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning queen regnant]] and female [[head of state]], the oldest and [[Current reigning monarchs by length of reign|longest-reigning current monarch]] and the [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest-serving current head of state]].\n\nElizabeth has occasionally faced [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] sentiments and press criticism of the [[British royal family|royal family]], in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her ''[[Annus horribilis#Elizabeth II|annus horribilis]]'' in 1992, and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales|death in 1997]] of her former daughter-in-law [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. However, support for the monarchy remains high, as does her personal popularity.<!--e.g. Polls cited in \"Public perception and character\" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006 and 2012); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair|Elizabeth on the [[List of covers of Time magazine (1920s)#1929|cover]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], April 1929]]\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 ([[GMT]]) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, [[King George V]].

Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed he would marry and have children of his own.<ref>Bond, p. 8; Lacey, p. 76; Pimlott, p. 3</ref> When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]], after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite [[Wallis Simpson]] provoked a constitutional crisis.<ref>Lacey, pp. 97–98</ref> Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became [[heir presumptive]]. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been [[heir apparent]] and above her in the line of succession.<ref>Marr, pp. 78, 85; Pimlott, pp. 71–73</ref>\n\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from [[Henry Marten (educator)|Henry Marten]], [[List of Provosts of Eton College|Vice-Provost]] of [[Eton College]],<ref>Brandreth, p. 124; Crawford, p. 85; Lacey, p. 112; Marr, p. 88; Pimlott, p. 51; Shawcross, p. 25</ref> and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.<ref name=Edu>{{cite web|title=Her Majesty The Queen: Early life and education| publisher=Royal Household| url=https://www.royal.uk/her-majesty-the-queen?ch=5| accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> A [[Girl Guides]] company, the [[Girlguiding London and South East England#1st Buckingham Palace Company|1st Buckingham Palace Company]], was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.<ref>Marr, p. 84; Pimlott, p. 47</ref> Later, she was enrolled as a [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Sea Ranger]].<ref name=Edu/>\n\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents [[1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada]] and the United States.

Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of [[Caernarfon Castle]] or a patron of [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]] (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with [[conscientious objector]]s in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm |title=Royal plans to beat nationalism |publisher=BBC News |date=8 March 2005|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Welsh politicians suggested she be made [[Princess of Wales]] on her 18th birthday.

On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, [[Sagana Lodge]], after a night spent at [[Treetops Hotel]], when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate [[Succession to the British throne|accession to the throne]].

The British Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], and Elizabeth's grandmother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], favoured the retention of the [[House of Windsor]], and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that ''Windsor'' would continue to be the name of the royal house.
