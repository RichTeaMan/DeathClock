She usually signed her work ''Z. Serebriakova'' or in Cyrillic script and sometimes she spelled her last name ''Serebriakoff'' (Rusakova 2006). Her family called her by the nicknames ''Zika'' and ''Zina'' (Serebriakova 1987).</ref> ({{lang-ru|Зинаи́да Евге́ньевна Серебряко́ва}}, {{OldStyleDate|12 December|1884|30 November}} &ndash; 19 September 1967) was a Russian (later French) painter.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Serebriakova portrait-of-e-solntseva-sister-of-artist-1914.jpg|thumb|left|''The Artist's Sister'', 1911]]\nZinaida Serebriakova was born on the estate of Neskuchnoye near Kharkov (now [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine) into one of the most refined and artistic families  in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nShe belonged to the artistic [[Benois family]]. Her grandfather, [[Nicholas Benois]], was a famous architect, chairman of the Society of Architects and member of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. Her uncle, [[Alexandre Benois]], was a famous painter, founder of the ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' art group. Her father, {{illm|Yevgeny Lanceray|WD=Q546558|lt=Yevgeny Nikolayevich Lanceray}}, was a well-known sculptor, and her mother, who was Alexandre Benois' sister, had a talent for drawing. One of Zinaida's brothers, [[Nikolay Lanceray]], was a talented architect, and her other brother, [[Yevgeny Yevgenyevich Lanceray]], had an important place in Russian and Soviet art as a master of monumental painting and [[graphic art]]. The Russian-English actor and writer [[Peter Ustinov]] was also related to her.\n\n==Youth==\n\nIn 1900 she graduated from a women's [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (equivalent to grammar school or high school), and entered the art school founded by [[Princess Maria Tenisheva]]. She studied under [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin|Repin]] in 1901, and under [[portrait]] artist [[Osip Braz]] between 1903 and 1905. In 1902–1903 she spent time in Italy, and from 1905 to 1906 she studied at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1905, she married her first cousin, Boris Serebriakov, the son of Evgenyi's sister, and took his surname. Serebriakova went on to become a railroad engineer.\n\n==Happy years==\n[[Image:Serebryakova Harvest 1915.jpg|250px|thumb|''Harvest'', 1915]]\nFrom her youth onwards, Zinaida Serebriakova strove to express her love of the world and to show its beauty. Her earliest works, ''Country Girl'' (1906, [[Russian Museum]]) and ''Orchard in Bloom'' (1908, private collection), speak eloquently of this search, and of her acute awareness of the beauty of the Russian land and its people. These works are études done from nature, and though she was young at the time, her extraordinary talent, confidence and boldness were apparent.\n\nBroad public recognition came with Serebriakova's self-portrait [[At the Dressing-Table]] (1909, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]), first shown at a large exhibition mounted by the [[Mir iskusstva|Union of Russian Artists]] in 1910.  The self-portrait was followed by ''Girl Bathing'' (1911, Russian Museum), a portrait of ''Ye.K.&nbsp;Lanceray'' (1911, private collection), and a portrait of the artist's mother ''Yekaterina Lanceray'' (1912, Russian Museum), already mature works, strict in composition.\n\nShe joined the ''Mir iskusstva'' movement in 1911, but stood out from the other members of the group because of her preference for popular themes and because of the harmony, plasticity and generalized nature of her paintings.\n\nIn 1914&ndash;1917, Zinaida Serebriakova was in her prime. During these years she produced a series of pictures on the theme of Russian rural life, the work of the peasants and the Russian countryside which was so dear to her heart: ''Peasants'' (1914&ndash;1915, Russian Museum), ''Sleeping Peasant Girl'' (private collection).\n\nThe most important of these works was ''Bleaching Cloth'' (1917, Tretyakov Gallery), which revealed Zinaida Serebriakova's striking talent as a monumental artist. The figures of the peasant women, portrayed against the background of the sky, gain majesty and power by virtue of the low horizon.\n\nWhen in 1916 Alexander Benois was commissioned to decorate the [[Moscow Kazanskaya railway station|Kazan Railway Station]] in Moscow, he invited Yevgeny Lanceray, [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]], and Zinaida Serebriakova to help him. Serebriakova took on the theme of the [[Orient]]: [[India]], Japan, [[Turkey]], and [[Thailand|Siam]] are represented allegorically in the form of beautiful women. At the same time she began compositions on subjects from classical mythology, but these remained [[unfinished work|unfinished]].\n\n==Revolution==\n\n[[Image:Serebryakova CardHause.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''House of Cards'', 1919]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] in 1917, Serebriakova was at her family estate of Neskuchnoye, and suddenly her whole life changed. In 1919 her husband Boris died of [[typhus]] contracted in [[Bolshevik]] jails. She was left without any income, responsible for her four children and her sick mother.  All the reserves of Neskuchnoye had been plundered, so the family suffered from hunger. She had to give up oil painting in favour of the less expensive techniques of charcoal and pencil. This was the time of her most tragic painting, [[:Image:Serebryakova CardHause.jpg|House of Cards]], which depicts her four orphaned children.\n\nShe did not want to switch to the [[Russian Futurism|futurist]] style popular in the art of the early Soviet period, nor paint portraits of [[commissar]]s, but she found some work at the [[Kharkov Archaeological Museum]], where she made pencil drawings of the exhibits. In December 1920 she moved to her grandfather’s apartment in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]]. After the [[October Revolution]], inhabitants of private apartments were forced to share them with additional inhabitants, but Serebriakova was lucky - she was quartered with artists from the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. Thus, Serebriakova's work during this period focuses on theatre life. Also around this time, Serebriakova's daughter, Tatiana, entered the academy of ballet, and Serebriakova created a series of pastels on the [[Mariinsky Theater]].\n\n==Paris==\n\n[[File:Serebriakova portrait-of-lola-braz-1910.jpg|thumb|333px|right|''Portrait of Lola Braz'', 1910]]\nIn the autumn of 1924, Serebriakova went to Paris, having received a commission for a large decorative mural. On finishing this work, she intended to return to the [[Soviet Union]], where her mother and the four children remained. However, she was not able to return, and although she was able to bring her younger children, Alexandre and Catherine, to Paris in 1926 and 1928 respectively, she could not do the same for her two older children, Evgenyi and Tatiana, and did not see them again for many years.\n\nAfter this, Zinaida Serebriakova traveled a great deal. In 1928 and 1930 she traveled to Africa, visiting [[Morocco]]. She was fascinated by the landscapes of northern Africa and painted the [[Atlas mountains]], as well as [[Arab]] women and [[Africans]] in ethnic clothing. She also painted a cycle devoted to [[Brittany|Breton]] fishermen. The salient feature of her later landscapes and portraits is the artist's own personality — her love of beauty, whether in nature or in people.\n\nIn 1947, Serebriakova at last took French citizenship, and it was not until [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khruschev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]] that the Soviet Government allowed her to resume contact with her family in the Soviet Union. In 1960, after 36&nbsp;years of forced separation, her older daughter, Tatiana (Tata), was finally allowed to visit her. At this time, Tatiana was also working as an artist, painting scenery for the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].\n\nZinaida Serebriakova's works were finally exhibited in the Soviet Union in 1966, in Moscow, [[Leningrad]], and [[Kiev]], to great acclaim. Her albums sold by the millions, and she was compared to [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. However, although she sent about 200 of her works to be shown in the Soviet Union, the bulk of her work remains in France today.\n\nZinaida Serebriakova died in Paris on 19 September 1967, at the age of 82. She is buried in Paris, at [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|the Russian cemetery]] at [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" widths=\"208\" heights=\"208\" caption=\"Zinaida Serebriakova's paintings  \">\nFile:1911.
