He was also instrumental in protecting wolves from eradication and in preserving the biological integrity of the [[Denali National Park]] and the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.wilderness.net/library/documents/IJWAug05_nixon.pdf | title=Science and Learning in the Alaskan Wilderness| first=Ingrid | last=Nixon | journal = International Journal of Wilderness|date=August 2005 | volume=11 | number= 2 | page= 35|accessdate=9 September 2013 }}</ref>  In 1989 Professor John A. Murray of the English Department at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks received an NEH grant to inventory the extensive Adolph Murie written and slide archives at Rasmusson Library in the Arctic and Polar Collection.  He wrote a forty-page report and biographical narrative of Adolph Murie, which remains unpublished but which is in his papers.\n\n==Early life==\nAdolf Winstrom was born on September 6, 1899, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], the child of Ed and Marie Winstrom.<ref>Joachim Murie died in 1895. His widow, Marie, married Ed Winstrom, their son Adolf was born in 1899, Winstrom died shortly thereafter, and Marie resumed using the surname ‘Murie.’ Once he was old enough, Adolf legally changed his surname to Murie to match his half-brother and mother and subsequently began spelling his first name ‘Adolph.’  See: {{cite journal |title = A Wilderness Apprenticeship | first=John | last=Little | journal=Environmental History|date=October 2000 | page = 542, Footnote 6 | publisher = American Society for Environmental History | jstor=3985585 | volume=5}}</ref>  In 1922, prior to completing college, Adolph Murie joined his brother, [[Olaus Murie]], on an expedition to [[Mt. McKinley National Park]], the first of many trips he would make to Alaska to do biological research. Murie received a bachelor's degree from [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]], and attended graduate school at the [[University of Michigan]], where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1929.<ref name=MurieRanch>{{cite journal | url={{NHLS url|id=98001039}} | title=Murie Ranch Historic District | journal=National Register of Historic Places Registration|publisher=U.

In total, he would spend the better part of thirty-two years working for the National Park Service and earned the National Park Service Distinguished Service Award.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.muriecenter.org/the-murie-legacy/adolph/\n|title=  Adolph Murie\n|publisher=   The Murie Center \n|accessdate= January 1, 2016}}</ref>\nIn 1937, Murie conducted a study of coyotes in [[Yellowstone National Park]], published as ''Ecology of the Coyote in Yellowstone.''  This book set off a storm of controversy within the Service, and represents one of the first studies published that argued against the Service’s long tradition of predator eradication.<ref name=MurieRanch/> In 1939, the National Park Service assigned Murie to assess the relationship between the [[Dall sheep]] and the [[wolf]] in the Mt. McKinley area. The resulting book, ''The Wolves of Mt. McKinley'', is considered a classic, especially given the detailed field observations which Murie spent hours collecting from 1939-1941, including the discovery that wolves ate mice.<ref>{{cite book | title=Where Mountains Are Nameless | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SK1Q9Imj4dUC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&f=false | last= Waterman | first= Jonathan | publisher=Norton| year=2005| location=New York | pages=86}}</ref> The publication of these two works led directly to the termination of the predator eradication programs in Yellowstone and Mt. McKinley national parks.<ref name=MurieRanch/>\nHe based himself in 1939 at [[Sanctuary River Cabin No. 31]], in Denali park, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Service, research and wildlife organizations==\nAlong with his brother, Olaus, Murie helped to enlarge existing national park boundaries and to create additional new units, notably the [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] in 1943 (it was upgraded to national park status several years later, then incorporated into the [[Grand Teton National Park]]).\n\nMurie’s book, ''A Naturalist in Alaska'', won the [[John Burroughs Medal]] in 1963. In addition to his books, Murie published numerous articles against predator control programs and excessive human intrusion on wilderness areas. He wrote letters and submitted testimony to Congress regarding [[Isle Royale]], [[Jackson Hole]], Mt. McKinley, and other wilderness areas threatened by development or predator control programs, including an article against pesticide use in [[Grand Teton National Park]] in 1966.\n\n==Legacy==\nAdolph Murie suffered from epilepsy and died from a seizure on August 16, 1974, at the STS Ranch,<ref>{{cite book | title=Where Aountains are Nameless | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SK1Q9Imj4dUC&pg=PA179&dq=epilepsy#v=onepage&q=epilepsy&f=false | last= Waterman | first= Jonathan | publisher=Norton| year=2005| location=New York | pages=179, 181}}</ref> now part of the [[Murie Ranch Historic District]] in [[Moose, Wyoming]].
