He is best known for his first book of poetry, ''Blue Juniata'' (1929), and his lyrical memoir, ''Exile's Return'' (1934; revised ed. 1951), as a chronicler and [[fellow traveller]] of the [[Lost Generation]], and as an influential editor and talent scout at [[Viking Press]].\n\n==Early life==\nCowley was born August 24, 1898, in [[Belsano, Pennsylvania|Belsano, Cambria County, Pennsylvania]], to William Cowley and Josephine Hutmacher.<ref>{{cite news |first= Albin |last= Krebs |title= Malcolm Cowley, Writer, Is Dead at 90 |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |page= A1| date= 29 May 1989}}</ref> He grew up in the [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], where his father, William, was a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctor. Cowley attended Shakespeare Street elementary school and in 1915 graduated from [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]], where his boyhood friend [[Kenneth Burke]] was also a student. Cowley's first published writing appeared in his high school newspaper.<ref>{{cite news |first= Albin |last= Krebs |title= Malcolm Cowley, Writer, Is Dead at 90 |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |page= A1| date= 29 May 1989}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Harvard University]], but his studies were interrupted when he joined the [[American Field Service]] during [[World War I]] to drive ambulances and munitions trucks for the French army. He returned to Harvard in 1919, when he became editor of ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]''. He graduated with a B.A. in 1920.<ref>{{cite news |first= Albin |last= Krebs |title= Malcolm Cowley, Writer, Is Dead at 90 |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |page= A1| date= 29 May 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Life in Paris==\nCowley was one of the literary and artistic figures who migrated to [[Paris]] in the 1920s. He became one of the best-known chroniclers of the American [[expatriate|expatriates]] in Europe, as he frequently spent time with writers like [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Erskine Caldwell]], and others associated with American literary [[modernism]]. In ''Blue Juniata'', Cowley described these Americans who travelled abroad during the postwar period as a \"wandering, landless, uprooted generation\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Cowley |first= Malcolm |date= 1929|title= Blue Juniata |publisher= Plimpton Press |page= 50}}</ref>; similarly Hemingway, claiming to have taken the phrase from Gertrude Stein, called them the \"lost generation\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Hemingway |first= Ernest |date= 1996|title= A Moveable Feast |publisher= Scribner}}</ref> This sense of uprootedness deeply affected Cowley's appreciation for the necessities of artistic freedom. It moreover informed his ideal of [[cosmopolitanism]] in contrast to the fervent [[nationalism]](s) that had led to World War I.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kirbach |first= Benjamin |editor-last= Glass |editor-first=Loren |title= After the Program Era: The Past, Present, and Future of Creative Writing in the University |chapter= Institutional Itinerancy: Malcolm Cowley and the Domestication of Cosmopolitanism |year= 2016 |publisher= The University of Iowa Press |page= 39 |isbn=978-1-60938-439-5}}</ref> Cowley recounted his experiences in  ''Exile's Return'', writing, \"our whole training was involuntarily directed toward destroying whatever roots we had in the soil, toward eradicating our local and regional peculiarities, toward making us homeless citizens of the world\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cowley |first= Malcolm |date= 1951|title= Exile's Return |edition= Revised |publisher= Viking Press |page= 27}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cowley associated with many American writers in Europe, the sense of admiration was not always mutual. Hemingway removed direct reference to Cowley in a later version of ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'', replacing his name with the description, \"that American poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the Dada movement\".<ref name=Schuyler>Kenneth Schuyler Lynn, ''Hemingway'', (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press) 1995.</ref> John Dos Passos's private correspondence revealed the contempt he held for Cowley, but also the care writers took to hide their personal feelings in order to protect their careers once Cowley had become an editor of ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref name=Schuyler/> Regardless, ''Exile's Return'' was one of the first autobiographical texts to foreground the American expatriate experience. Despite not selling well during its first publication, it established Cowley as one of the most trenchant emissaries of the Lost Generation. Literary historian [[Van Wyck Brooks]] described ''Exile's Return'' as \"an irreplaceable literary record of the most dramatic period in American literary history.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Early Career and Involvement in Politics==\nWhile in Paris, Cowley found himself drawn to the [[avant-garde]] sensibilities of [[Dada]], and also, like many other intellectuals of the period, to [[Marxism]] and its attempts to demystify the socioeconomic and political conditions that had plunged Europe into a devastating war.<ref>{{cite news |first= Albin |last= Krebs |title= Malcolm Cowley, Writer, Is Dead at 90 |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |page= A1| date= 29 May 1989}}</ref> He travelled frequently between Paris and [[Greenwich Village]] in New York, and through these intersecting social circles came into close proximity, though he never officially joined, with the [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]]. In 1929, Cowley became an associate editor of the liberal magazine ''The New Republic'', which he steered in \"a resolutely communist direction\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Benfey |first= Christopher |title= Review of ''The Long Voyage: Selected Letters of Malcolm Cowley, 1915-1987'', Hans Bak (ed.) |url= https://newrepublic.com/article/116499/long-voyage-selected-letters-malcolm-cowley-reviewed |journal= ''The New Republic'' |date= 28 Feb 2014}}</ref> By the early 1930s, Cowley became increasingly involved in radical politics. In 1932, he joined Edmund Wilson, [[Mary Heaton Vorse]], and [[Waldo Frank]] as union-sponsored observers of the miners' strikes in Kentucky. Their lives were threatened by the mines' owners, and Frank was badly beaten.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} When ''Exile's Return'' was first published in 1934, it put forth a distinctly Marxist interpretation of history and social struggle. \n\nIn 1935, Cowley helped to establish a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] collective, The [[League of American Writers]]. Other notable members included [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Carl Van Doren]], Waldo Frank, [[David Ogden Stewart]], John Dos Passos, [[Lillian Hellman]], and [[Dashiell Hammett]]. Cowley was appointed Vice President, and over the next few years became involved in numerous campaigns, including attempts to persuade the [[United States]] government to support the Republicans in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He resigned in 1940, owing to concerns that the organization was too heavily influenced by the Communist Party.\n\nIn 1941, near the outset of the United States' involvement in [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Cowley's associate, poet and \"[[popular front]]\" interventionist Archibald MacLeish, as head of the War Department's Office of Facts and Figures (precursor to the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]]). MacLeish recruited Cowley as an analyst. This decision resulted in [[Anticommunism|anti-communist]] journalists such as [[Whittaker Chambers]] and [[Westbrook Pegler]] publicly exposing Cowley's left-wing sympathies. Cowley soon found himself in the crosshairs of congressman [[Martin Dies, Jr.|Martin Dies]] (D-Tex.) and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Dies accused Cowley of belonging to seventy-two communist or communist-front organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Benfey |first= Christopher |title= Review of ''The Long Voyage: Selected Letters of Malcolm Cowley, 1915-1987'', Hans Bak (ed.) |url= https://newrepublic.com/article/116499/long-voyage-selected-letters-malcolm-cowley-reviewed |journal= ''The New Republic'' |date= 28 Feb 2014}}</ref> This number was certainly an exaggeration, but Cowley had no recourse to deny it. MacLeish soon came under pressure from [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] to dismiss Cowley. In January of 1942, MacLeish sent his reply that the FBI needed a course of instruction in history. \"Don't you think it would be a good thing if all investigators could be made to understand that [[Liberalism in the United States|Liberalism]] is not only not a crime but actually the attitude of the President of the United States and the greater part of his Administration?\", he said.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Nevertheless, Cowley resigned two months later, vowing to never write about politics again.\n\n==Editorial Career and Academia==\nIn 1944, having been more or less silenced politically, Cowley began a career as a literary advisor, editor, and talent scout at Viking Press. He was hired to work on the ''Portable Library'' series, which had started in 1943 with ''As You Were: A Portable Library of American Prose and Poetry Assembled for Members of the Armed Forces and Merchant Marine''. In its inception, the ''Portable Library'' was an anthology of paperback reprints that could be mass-produced cheaply and marketed to military personnel. It also emphasized an American literary tradition that could be construed as patriotic during wartime. Yet Cowley was able to steer the series toward what were, in his esteem, underappreciated writers. \n\nHe first set out to edit ''The Portable Hemingway'' (1944). At the time, Hemingway was considered a sparse and simplistic writer; Cowley departed from this in his introductory essay, claiming instead that Hemingway could be read as tortured and submerged. This revaluation remains the dominant critical opinion today. Literary critic [[Mark McGurl]] argues that Hemingway's tip-of-the-iceberg style has become one of the most emulated in twentieth-century American prose, his name all but synonymous with the \"pathos of understatement\" and \"the value of craft as represented by the practice of multiple revision\".<ref>{{cite book |last= McGurl |first= Mark |title= The Program Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing |year= 2009 |publisher= Harvard University Press |pages= 244-45}}</ref>\n\n''The Portable Hemingway'' sold so well that Cowley was able to convince Viking to publish a ''Portable Faulkner'' in 1946. [[William Faulkner]] was, at the time, slipping into literary obscurity; by the 1930s, he was working as a Hollywood screenwriter and in danger of seeing his works go out of print. Cowley again argued for a dramatic revaluation of Faulkner's position in American letters, enlisting him as an honorary member of the Lost Generation. [[Robert Penn Warren]] called ''The Portable Faulkner'' the \"great watershed\" moment for Faulkner's reputation, and many scholars view Cowley's essay as having resuscitated Faulkner's career.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Warren |first= Robert Penn |editor= Robert Penn Warren (ed.) |title= Introduction |encyclopedia= Faulkner: A Collection of Critical Essays |year= 1966 |publisher= Prentice Hall |pages= 10}}</ref> Faulkner won a [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] in 1949. He later said, \"I owe Malcolm Cowley the kind of debt no man could ever repay\".<ref>{{cite news |first= Albin |last= Krebs |title= Malcolm Cowley, Writer, Is Dead at 90 |publisher= ''The New York Times'' |page= A1| date= 29 May 1989}}</ref>\n\nCowley then published a revised edition of ''Exile's Return'' in 1951. The revisions downplayed some of the more radical Marxist tenets, and emphasized the ''return'' of the exile as a necessary step toward reestablishing a nation's solidarity: \"the old pattern of alienation and reintegration, or departure and return, that is repeated in scores of European myths and continually re-embodied in life\", Cowley wrote.<ref>{{cite book |last= Cowley |first= Malcolm |date= 1951|title= Exile's Return |edition= Revised |publisher= Viking Press |page= 289}}</ref> This time the book sold much better. Cowley also published a ''Portable [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]]'' (1948), ''The Literary Tradition'' (1954), and edited a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' (1959), by Walt Whitman. These were followed by ''Black Cargoes, A History of the Atlantic Slave Trade'' (1962), ''Fitzgerald and the Jazz Age'' (1966), ''Think Back on Us'' (1967), ''Collected Poems'' (1968), ''Lesson of the Masters'' (1971) and ''A Second Flowering'' (1973).\n\nCowley taught creative writing at the college-level beginning in the 1950s. Among his students were [[Larry McMurtry]], [[Peter S. Beagle]], [[Wendell Berry]], as well as [[Ken Kesey]], whose ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1962) Cowley helped publish at Viking. Writing workshops were a recent development at the time (the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] was founded in 1936), yet by midcentury their proliferation was of note for both writers and publishers. Cowley taught also at Yale, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, California at Irvine and Berkeley, and even the prestigious [[Stegner Fellowship]] at Stanford, among other places, but he seldom maintained a full-time teaching appointment. Literary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that this flitting back-and-forth between universities and the publishing industry allowed Cowley to reconcile his cosmopolitan ideal within the constraints of the academy. Kirbach writes: \"Cowley's itinerancy—his seemingly effortless movement between universities and the publishing industry, between writers individual and collective—played a crucial role in institutionalizing [literary] modernism\" in the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kirbach |first= Benjamin |editor-last= Glass |editor-first=Loren |title= After the Program Era: The Past, Present, and Future of Creative Writing in the University |chapter= Institutional Itinerancy: Malcolm Cowley and the Domestication of Cosmopolitanism |year= 2016 |publisher= The University of Iowa Press |pages=39-51 |isbn=978-1-60938-439-5}}</ref>\n\nAs an editorial consultant to Viking Press, he pushed for the publication of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]''. Cowley's work anthologizing 28 [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]] short stories and editing a reissue of ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'', restructured based on Fitzgerald's notes, both in 1951, were key to reviving Fitzgerald's reputation as well, and his introduction to [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', written in the early 1960s, is said to have had a similar effect on Anderson's reputation.<!-- doesn't the writer of this like to breathe? -->  Other works of literary and critical importance include ''Eight More Harvard Poets'' (1923), ''A Second Flowering: Works & Days of the Lost Generation'' (1973), ''And I Worked at the Writer's Trade'' (1978), and ''The Dream of the Golden Mountains: Remembering the 1930s'' (1980).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n''And I Worked'' won a 1980 U.S. [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Biography|one-year category Autobiography]].<ref name=nba1980>\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1980.html \"National Book Awards – 1980\"].

Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one.</ref>\n\nWhen  ''The Portable Malcolm Cowley'' (Donald Faulkner, editor) was published in 1990, the year after Cowley's death, Michael Rogers wrote in ''Library Journal'':  \"Though a respected name in hardcore literary circles, in general the late Cowley is one of the unsung heroes of 20th-century American literature. Poet, critic, Boswell of the [[Lost Generation]] of which he himself was a member, savior of Faulkner's dwindling reputation, editor of Kerouac's On the Road, discoverer of John Cheever, Cowley knew everybody and wrote about them with sharp insight. . . . . Cowley's writings on the great books are as important as the books themselves . . . . All American literature collections should own this.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nTo the end, Cowley remained a [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] in the world of letters. He wrote writer [[Louise Bogan]] in 1941, \"I'm almost getting pathologically tender-hearted. I have been caused so much pain by reviewers and political allrightniks of several shades of opinion that I don't want to cause pain to anybody.\"<ref>Letter to poet/novelist Louise Bogan, [[Swann Auction Galleries]], Sale 2157: Modern Literature Featuring Americans in Paris.
