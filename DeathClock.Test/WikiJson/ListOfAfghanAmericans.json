This list generally excludes Ethnic Pashtuns and South Asian Muslims of Pashtun ancestry as they originate outside Afghanistan's borders.\n\nTo be included in this list, the person must have a Wikipedia article showing they are Afghan American or must have independent references showing they are Afghan American and are notable. Pashtun ancestry will not count if the person came legally outside Afghanistan's territory at the time of their origin.\n\nThis list excludes Ethnic Pashtuns or South Asian Muslims of Pashtun ancestry that happen to be in America but originate outside Afghanistan's official borders. This is because of territorial changes in Afghanistan where substantial Pashtun regions were lost from Afghanistan. The definition Afghan therefore no longer applies to Pashtun people outside Afghanistan, conversely, Pathan is another term used upon Ethnic Pashtuns. For Ethnic Pashtuns, see :[[Pashtun diaspora]]. Pathans or Pashtuns outside Afghanistan's then regions are excluded from Afghans with a few exceptions.\n<br />\n{{Expand list|date=March 2009}}\n<!-- Please do not add , non-notable people or fictional characters.
