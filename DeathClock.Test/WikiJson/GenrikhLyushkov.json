His subsequent disappearance has been subject to controversy and speculation by journalists and scholars.\n\n==Early life==\nLyushkov was born in [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1900. His [[Jews|Jewish]] father supported him and his siblings as a tailor. He began his education in 1908 in a state-owned, six-classroom school, continuing there until 1915. While in school, he was influenced by his brother (a member of the [[Bolshevik]] underground) to join the [[Bolshevik Party]] and take part in the [[Russian Revolution]] several years later.\n\nIn April 1919, he received political training in [[Kiev]] for the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. During this time, the [[Russian Civil War]] broke out and after his graduation in September of that year, Lyushkov was assigned to the [[Bolshevik]] 14th Army for political work, where he saw combat against [[Poland|Poles]] and the [[White movement|White Russian]] forces of [[Anton Denikin]]. By then, he was a fully-fledged [[Commissar#Political commissar|political commissar]] and had received the [[Order of the Red Banner]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=407}}<ref name=\"Kuksin\" />\n\n==Secret police==\nIn November 1920, he joined the [[Cheka]] of [[Odessa]], which became known for its ruthlessness.<ref name=\"Berkman\" /> He also served in [[Moscow]] and [[Ukraine]]. When the Cheka was disbanded and reformed into the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] (the Государственное политическое управление НКВД РСФСР or \"State Political Directorate\"), Lyushkov rose even further. Around 1930,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} he carried out an [[industrial espionage]] assignment in [[Germany]], where he monitored activities within the [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] aviation company, bringing him the favour of [[Joseph Stalin]]. This success led to his working again within the USSR, now as a member of the [[NKVD]] (the Народный комиссариат внутренних дел or \"People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs\"). He was quickly transferred to preferential positions such as his posting as the NKVD chief in the [[Sea of Azov]]-[[Black Sea]] region{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} as well as being awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] \"for exemplary performance of tasks of the Party and government.\"<ref name=\"Kuksin\" /> He was also made a deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]].\n\nDuring the time of the [[Moscow Trials]], he was the one who led the interrogations of [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]].<ref name=\"Medvedev\" /> Later, he earned a reputation as \"an arrogant, arbitrary and sadistic bully....\"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} On 31 July 1937, he received his final posting, as the NKVD chief in the [[Russian Far East]], where he had direct command over \"20,000&ndash;30,000 élite NKVD troops.\"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=409}}\n\nWhen he was given the post, he was, according to a later interview with Japanese military officials, given personal orders to aid in the elimination of specific officials as a part of the [[Great Purge]]: [[Vsevolod Balitsky]] (the former [[NKVD]] chief in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]], whom Lyushkov was replacing), [[Vasily Blyukher]] (a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]), and A. I. Lapin (the Far East Air Corps Commander). Balitsky, Blyukher, and Lapin all fell victim to the Great Purge. Balitsky's arrest and execution resulted from evidence gathered by Lyushkov. Blyukher's arrest and subsequent death resulted from blame being assigned to him for Lyushkov's defection. Lapin committed suicide while imprisoned.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}}\n\nPrompted by his Japanese interrogators, Lyushkov gave one of the earliest explanations of the circumstances of the [[Great Purge]], arguing that he had been merely appeasing Stalin and that he had no choice but to carry out his orders. Lyushkov, immediately upon arriving in [[Khabarovsk]], saw that Balitsky had been arrested and sent to Moscow for trial and execution.\n\nHowever, his time in the post proved to be short. When the Great Purge was near its peak and NKVD boss [[Nikolai Yezhov]] was gradually losing power, Lyushkov received a summons to return to Moscow, but strongly suspected that it would mean his own arrest and execution, since his own two predecessors in his post, [[Terenty Deribas]] and Balitsky, had both been purged. Balitsky had been convicted on information from Lyushkov himself, whom he had considered a friend.<ref name=\"Kuksin\" />\n\nBy then, Lyushkov had been promoted to \"third-rank commissar of state security\" (комиссар госбезопасности 3-го ранга) or \"Commissar 3rd Class\", the approximate equivalent of a [[major-general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=405}}\n\n==Defection==\nIn preparation for his defection, Lyushkov arranged for his Jewish wife, Inna, to leave the country with his eleven-year-old daughter, for the daughter to receive medical treatment in [[Poland]]. The plan was for Inna to embed a secret codeword into a [[telegram]], which would signal to Lyushkov that it was safe for him to leave the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nUnder unknown circumstances, however, Inna and her daughter were captured. Though the daughter's fate remains unknown, Inna was kept at the [[Lubyanka prison]] and tortured for information throughout late 1938 before eventually being executed.<ref name=\"Kuksin\" /> Other members of Lyushkov's family were arrested and imprisoned in Siberian [[gulag]]s.<ref name=\"Kuksin\" /> While his mother and brother were both killed, his sister survived her imprisonment.<ref name=\"Kuksin\" />\n\nOn 13 June 1938, Lyushkov defected from the [[Soviet Union]] by crossing the border into [[Manchukuo]] with valuable secret documents about the Soviet military strength in the region, which was much greater than the Japanese had realised. He was the highest-ranking secret police official to defect; he also had the greatest inside knowledge about the purges within the Soviet [[Red Army]] because of his own participation in carrying them out.\n\nHis defection was initially kept a state secret by [[Japan]], but the revelation of his defection was judged to have a high [[propaganda]] value,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} so the decision was made to release the news to the world. A press conference was arranged at a [[Tokyo]] hotel on 13 July,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} a month after Lyushkov had defected. He \"categorically denied Moscow's allegation that he was an imposter\"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} but some news agencies, such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' wondered if he was telling the truth.\n\nDuring subsequent interviews and interactions with Japanese military personnel, Lyushkov adopted an anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] position.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=412}} However, his professed political views remained [[socialism|socialistic]] in nature according to the recollections of some Japanese intelligence officers, with Lyushkov calling himself a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]],{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} but some Japanese officers believed that he had later become a [[Liberal socialism|liberal communist]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}} Though Lyushkov was anti-Stalinist, he was resistant to the idea of creating a new regime led by Russian [[emigrants|émigrés]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}} He was, however, willing to include them in a proposed plan for the assassination of Stalin.\n\nA resistance group of Russian emigrants would travel across the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-Soviet border when Stalin would travel south to a resort in [[Sochi]], which he had visited previously to swim in the [[Matsesta River]]. Lyushkov's intimate knowledge of NKVD procedures and the way Stalin's guard detail would be organised encouraged the Japanese to support the plan. However, a Soviet agent had infiltrated the group of Russian exiles and foiled the plan, which was considered the only serious attempt to assassinate Stalin.<ref name=\"Kuksin\" />\n\nLyushkov was able to detail the strength of the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]], [[Siberia]] and [[Ukraine]], simultaneously providing Soviet military radio codes. He was considered highly intelligent and dedicated,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=412}} producing great volumes of written material,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} but there was some uncertainty about his ability to provide useful information specific to military operations.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}}\n\nAs he spent more time in Japan, his hard work impressed the Japanese intelligence officers with whom he had been assigned to work. The staff of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had concerns, however, about his psychological state, especially pertaining to the status of his wife and daughter, about whom he had heard no news since his defection. After a failed search by Japanese intelligence agents for his family, a plan to both pacify and \"domesticate\"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} Lyushkov was decided upon: he would be paired with a woman, both to distract him from the question of his family's status and to keep him rooted in Japan. An eventual match was found after Lyushkov refused several [[White émigré]] women.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}}\n\nAt some point, he began to make plans to travel to the [[United States]] and contacted an American publisher about a possible autobiography that he would write. He had concerns that he might be prevented from leaving Japan and went as far as to negotiate a written safe-conduct guarantee.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=417}}\n\n== Disappearance ==\nAfter Germany's capitulation, Lyushkov was sent on 20 July 1945 to work for the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]]'s Special Intelligence authorities in the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}} On 9 August 1945, the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] commenced and Lyushkov vanished in the confusion of the assault, where he was reportedly last seen in a crowd at a [[Dalian|Dairen]] train station.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}}\n\nOther theories hold that he was captured by the [[Red Army]] or that he was killed on the orders of a Japanese Special Intelligence officer to prevent him from giving away Japanese military secrets to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}}<ref name=\"Memo.ru\" /> Lyushkov's ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Eastern Bloc defectors]]\n* [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=\"Berkman\">{{cite book\n | last = Alexander\n | first = Berkman\n | authorlink = Alexander Berkman\n | title = [[The Bolshevik Myth|The Bolshevik Myth (Diary 1920&ndash;1922)]]\n | publisher = Pluto Press\n | location = London\n | accessdate = 12 February 2012\n | origyear = 1925\n | year = 1989\n | isbn = 1-85305-032-6\n | oclc = 1144036\n | chapter = Chapter 32: Odessa: Life and Vision\n | chapterurl = http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/berkman/bmyth/bmch32.html\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kuksin\">{{cite journal\n| last = Kuksin\n| first = Ilya\n| date = 17 August 1999\n| year =\n| month =\n| script-title=ru:ПОБЕГ СТОЛЕТИЯ\n|trans-title=Flight of the Century\n| magazine = Vestnik\n| volume = 17\n| issue = 224\n| publisher = Vestnik Information Agency\n| language = Russian\n| accessdate = 12 February 2012\n| url = http://www.vestnik.com/issues/1999/0817/win/kuksin.htm\n}}\n\n</ref>\nKuksin, Ilya. \"ПОБЕГ СТОЛЕТИЯ\" (\"Escape of the Century\").
