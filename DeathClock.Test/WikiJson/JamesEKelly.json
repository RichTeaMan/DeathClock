Perhaps because of that he early developed a lifelong interest in American history, particularly in the Civil War and in the generals who fought it. His intense studies into history allowed Kelly to bring to his work a degree of detail that makes his drawings and statues noteworthy.\n\n[[File:Fh-mollypitcher.jpg|thumb|left|''Molly Pitcher'' (1884), Monmouth Battle Monument, [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold, New Jersey]].]]\nHe studied at the [[National Academy of Design]], and was one of the founders of the [[Art Students League of New York]]. He worked as a wood engraver, as an illustrator for [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Monthly]] and other magazines, and for a time shared a studio with artist [[Edwin Austin Abbey]].<ref>Leach, p. 446.</ref>\n\nIn 1882 Kelly was commissioned by Oscar Wilde and his touring manager to make a [https://web.archive.org/web/20131022062817/http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lecture-tour/the-kelly-sketch.html sketch and bas-relief of Wilde] for use in promoting [https://web.archive.org/web/20131022062759/http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lecture-tour/index.html Wilde's lecture tour of North America].\n\nKelly, [[Daniel Chester French]], and [[Cyrus Edwin Dallin]] were the finalists in an 1883 national design competition to model an equestrian statue of [[Paul Revere]] for [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>George Wharton James, ''Utah: The Land of Blossoming Valleys'' (Boston: The Page Company, 1922), p. 303.</ref> Dallin won the competition and the commission.\n\nKelly's first major commission was for the 1884 [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth Battle Monument]] &ndash; five bronze relief panels depicting scenes from the battle. He had a difficult time finding models who did not have mustaches or beards &ndash; then being worn by most men of that era &ndash; so he prevailed upon a friend from nearby [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]], to pose for him. Because of that, a portrait of the 30-year-old [[Thomas Alva Edison]] can be found on the  monument as [[Molly Pitcher]]'s wounded husband.<ref>Leach, p. 450.</ref>\n\nKelly was also known for his extremely detailed and accurate engravings on historical subjects, often commissioned by magazines. He was a careful researcher, interviewing the soldiers present at the Civil War battles he depicted, and exacting about getting the details right in his works. Late in life, he hoped to publish a book of his interviews with generals and other Civil War soldiers, but there was little interest.\n\nHe married Helen McKay (1871-1929), but no children survived them. He died in New York City, and was buried in an unmarked grave in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|Saint Raymond's Cemetery]].\n\nHistorian William B. Styple edited Kelly's sometimes-provocative military interviews into a 2005 book, ''Generals in Bronze.'' Styple also raised funds to buy a headstone for Kelly's grave. On October 1, 2006, a black granite monument with Kelly's image carved into it and the words, \"A Sculptor of American History\" was placed over the artist's previously unmarked grave.<ref>[http://www.mail.com/news/politics/1704818-ohio-was-crucial-politically-lincoln-too.html William B.
