From a family of architects, she was the first woman elected a [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]] (FAIA) in Georgia and only the eighth woman nationwide. Several buildings she designed (including her own home) are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). In 2016 she was posthumously named a [[Georgia Women of Achievement|Georgia Woman of Achievement]].\n\n==Biography==\nEllamae Ellis was born in [[Macon, Georgia]] on July 9, 1899, the fourth child of Susan Dilworth Choate and Joseph Oliver Ellis.{{sfn|Ray|2005}} She attended public schools and graduated from [[Lanier High School (Macon, Georgia)|Lanier High School]] in 1916.{{r|faia_nomination}}. She attended nearby [[Wesleyan College]] in 1917 and 1918{{sfn|League|1946|p=1}} but did not graduate, as her marriage to George Forest League on June 27, 1917,{{sfn|Ray|2005}} would change her path.\n\nLeague's children Jean and Joe were born in 1919 and 1921. In 1922 her husband of five years left her, so she found herself divorced with two children and no means of income. Six generations of her family had been architects including [[Charles Edward Choate]], a well known architect in [[Atlanta]] at the time.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=16}} Several other relatives were artists including [[Nell Choate Jones]] and [[Nell Choate Shute]].{{r|colmuseum}} According to League's son Joe, the architect [[Curran R. Ellis]] (1872–1934), who designed the [[Bibb County Courthouse (Georgia)|county courthouse]] and [[Luther Williams Field|baseball stadium]] in Macon, is a distant relative as well.{{r|little_martha}} League credited her uncle with \"putting the idea in her head\" of becoming an architect.{{sfn|McMullen|2013|p=16}}\n\n===Early career===\nIn 1922 the [[Georgia School of Technology]], whose [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|Department of Architecture]] was the primary venue for architecture education in Georgia,{{r|bwaf}} did not allow women to attend. (This would not change until 1952).{{r|gatech_women}} In a later newspaper interview League observed, \"it's almost impossible to get a license in this state, unless you have a diploma from Georgia Tech. And women are barred as students there.\"{{sfn|McMullen|2013|p=16}}\n\nLeague had to seek out a different route to an architectural education. She found a job as an apprentice at the Macon firm of [[Dunwody and Oliphant]], where she worked from 1922 to 1929.{{sfn|League|1946|p=1}} While working, she took correspondence courses{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=16}} from the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]] (BAID) from 1924 to 1926.{{sfn|League|1946|p=1}}  BAID was modeled after the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in France and League wanted to take her education further in that vein. Leaving her young children with her parents, she continued her education with a year at [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts at Fontainebleau]], which she attended with her cousin Nell Choate Shute in 1927 and 1928. Of the thirty people in her architecture class there, only three were women.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Herman_Shaver_House,_Wayside,_GA,_US.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Herman and Allene Shaver House]] (1936)|alt=A brick home with brown trim and a large lawn in front.]]\nUpon her return she worked with other architects in Macon including George W. Shelverton and William F. Oliphant. When Oliphant started his own firm, League went with him along with Delmar A. Warren, a Georgia Tech student. Oliphant died suddenly in April 1933 at the age of 40,{{r|withey}} leaving League and Warren with a problem – neither was licensed, so they could finish existing commissions but could not legally accept new work.{{sfn|Love|1981|pp=16&ndash;17|ps=. cited in {{harvnb|Brock|2004|p=16}}}}\n\nThe state registration for architects in Georgia required either an architecture degree (which League did not have) or ten years experience in a licensed office (which she did) and passing a week-long examination. Her uncle gave her a crash course in the engineering parts of the test with which she was not familiar. She passed that part of the exam but failed the test on design – which was her strong suit. (One of the examiners disliked her submission). She commented later that the test was \"designed to keep you out.\" She quickly retook that part of the exam and passed.{{sfn|Love|1981|pp=18&ndash;19|ps=. cited in {{harvnb|Brock|2004|pp=16–17}}}}\n\n===Her own practice===\nLeague opened her own firm in October 1933.{{sfn|League|1946|p=1}} At that time only two percent of American architects were women, and the percentage of women architects in Georgia was particularly low. League was only the fourth woman registered as an architect in the state.{{sfn|Smith|1979|p=85-87|ps=. cited in {{harvnb|Brock|2004|p=17}}}} Most women architects at this time concentrated on residence design, but League took on a wide variety of projects.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=17}} The list of her commissions from 1934 through 1969 includes many residences but also offices, retail stores, churches, schools, public housing, auditoriums, gymnasiums, hospitals, a service station and a reservoir.{{sfn|Love|League|2004}}\n\n[[File:1271_S._Jackson_Springs_Road.JPG|right|thumb|The Lee Happ house (1941) at 1271 South Jackson Springs Road in Shirley Hills is her \"best known and most copied residential design\".{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=13}}|alt=Photo of a two-story brick home painted grey with black shutters.]]\n{{quote |text=I am always an architect. Not a woman architect, but an architect. I encourage women going into the profession not to concentrate on being separate as a woman but to concentrate on being a good architect. |author=Ellamae Ellis League |source=''[[Macon Telegraph]]'' interview, 1962{{r|telegraph2016}}}}\n\nAs her firm was founded in the middle of the [[Great Depression]], one source of non-residence projects were commissions by the [[Public Works Administration]]. League designed a number of schools and hospitals. These became \"her favorite projects, because they were so complex and were public buildings.\"{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=17}}\n\nAnother source of many commissions was James H. Porter, president of the Macon-based Bibb Manufacturing Company.{{sfn|Pallante|1999|p=7}} His philanthropic commissions for League in Macon led to work in other locations where Bibb had operations around the statue, including [[Porterdale, Georgia|Porterdale]]{{r|gatrust}} and [[Bibb City, Georgia|Bibb City]].{{r|nrhp_bibb}}\n\nLeague did not establish her own distinctive style but instead followed the Ecole des Beaux Arts philosophy of \"designing something that answers the need of the owner as far as function is concerned and which is pleasant to look at for both the owner and the public.\"{{sfn|Love|1981|p=46|ps=. cited in {{harvnb|Brock|2004|p=17}}}} She designed buildings in such styles as [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]]{{sfn|Pallante|1999|p=6}}{{sfn|Speno|2014|p=7}}{{r|gashpo2013}}, [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]]{{r|nrhp_bibb}}, [[Vernacular architecture|French Vernacular Revival]],{{sfn|Speno|2014|p=7}} [[Modern architecture|Contemporary]],{{sfn|Speno|2014|p=4}} and others.\n\nHer firm expanded in the [[Post-World War II]] era, and League hired many young architects and gave them their start.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=18}} Her own daughter Jean (later known as Jean League Newton) graduated from the [[Harvard School of Design]] in 1944{{r|sun1956}} and joined League in her architectural practice.{{sfn|Berkeley|McQuaid|1989|p=180}} The firm eventually changed its name to League, Warren & Riley.{{sfn|Pallante|1999|p=7}}\n\nOver her career League undertook commissions in five states and 42 different counties in Georgia. A collection of 9,200 of her architectural drawings is held at the [[Middle Georgia Regional Library System|Washington Memorial Library]] in Macon.{{r|bibblib}}\n\n===Community involvement===\nShe was selected to be a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) in June 1944,{{sfn|AIA|1991|p=6}} only the second woman from Georgia. For years she was the only woman member of the Atlanta chapter of AIA, and held several offices at the chapter and state level.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=18}} In 1957 she established the Macon chapter of AIA and was its first president. Later she was chairman of the committee formed to unify the Georgia chapters, and served as president of the resulting Georgia Council of AIA from 1963 to 1964.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=19}}\n\nIn 1968 League became the first woman in Georgia to be named a [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]],{{r|allaback}} having been nominated for that honor by the Georgia Council \"for service to the profession.\"{{r|faia_nomination}} She was one of only eight women architects named an FAIA up to that date.{{sfn|Ray|2005}}\n\nShe was also involved in various civic organizations in Macon including the Macon Civic Improvement Committee and the Macon Little Theater.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=19}} When demolition was threatened for Macon's [[Grand Opera House (Macon, Georgia)|Grand Opera House]] in 1967, League helped form the Macon Arts Council, Inc. to save it, and subsequently supervised the restoration of the building in 1969 and 1970.{{r|nrhp_opera}}\n\n===Later life===\n\nLeague retired from her practice in 1975 after suffering a serious illness{{r|illness}} but remained an [[Emeritus]] member of AIA.{{sfn|AIA|1991|p=23}} She continued to receive honors from her profession after her retirement (see [[#Honors|Honors]] below). She died on March 4, 1991{{sfn|Ray|2005}} and is buried in [[Riverside Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Riverside Cemetery]] in Macon.{{r|telegraph2016b}}{{r|riverside}}\n\nThe tradition of architects in League's family has continued. Along with her daughter Jean, her grandson Joseph Choate League Jr. (b. 1944) is also an architect.{{sfn|Cloues|2008|p=19}}\n\n== {{Anchor|House}} Ellamae Ellis League House ==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name                 = Ellamae Ellis League House\n| nocat=yes\n| nrhp_type            = nrhp\n| nrhp_type2        = cp\n| image                = File:Ellamae Ellis League House, Macon, GA, US.jpg\n| alt                  = Photo of a home with unpainted redwood siding sitting among trees.\n| caption              = League's personal home, which she designed in 1940 and lived in for the rest of her life.\n| locmapin             = \n| map_alt              = \n| map_caption          = \n| coordinates          = {{Coord|32.871280|-83.631979|region:US-GA|display=inline}}.\n| location             = 1790 Waverland Drive, Macon, Georgia\n| built                = 1940\n| architect            = Ellamae Ellis League\n| architecture         = \n| added                = February 15, 2005\n| designated_nrhp_type2 = May 27, 2014\n| refnum               = 05000053{{sfn|Brock|2004}}\n| mpsub                = \n| partof = Shirley Hills Historic District{{sfn|Speno|2014|p=2}}\n| partof_refnum = 14000269\n}}\nLeague's home in Macon is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was featured by the National Park Service during [[Women's History Month]] in 2005.{{r|nps}} In 1940 both her children were in college and she no longer needed to live close to work or schools. So she designed her own home to be built in the (then) new Shirley Hills neighborhood northwest of downtown Macon.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=19}}\n\nWhat she designed is an asymmetrical ranch house with a [[Split-level home|split-level]] floor plan. Although this would become very common in later decades, this is one of the earliest in Georgia – only two others are known that predate it. It represents a move away from the [[bungalow]] style prevalent in prior years.{{sfn|Brock|2004|pp=13–14}}\n\nThe house has garages on the basement level, living spaces on level one and two bedrooms above.{{sfn|Brock|2004|p=3}} League, who said once she had \"an aversion\" to the local Macon brick so common in home designs, decided to sheath the house in redwood siding.{{r|bwaf}}\n\nLeague lived in this house from 1940 until her death in 1991. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2005.{{sfn|Brock|2004}} It was the first mid-century ranch house in Georgia to be listed in the NRHP.{{r|bwaf}}\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Jones County High School, Gray, GA, US (02).jpg|right|thumb|[[Jones County High School]] (1936)|alt=Photo of a red brick building with white trim.]]\n*[[Jones County High School]] (aka Gray High School) 161 W Clinton St, [[Gray, Georgia]] (1936) [[NRHP]]-listed{{sfn|Pallante|1999}} One of League's Public Works Administration commissions, it is now repurposed as the W.E.

Not any more than against younger women! Down in Macon, Ga., Ellamae League started her career, in order to support her two children, without a day's previous training. Her first job was as a draftswoman in the office of a local architect. In 1928, convinced that architecture was the field for her, she left her two children with their grandmother and went off to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. After serving her apprenticeship, she opened her own office in Georgia about 20 years ago. Her architectural assignments have included working on schools, mill villages, stores, factories, private homes and the Macon airport building. Besides, she has a bonus satisfaction in her career. Her daughter, Jean, who graduated from the Harvard School of Design in 1944, also is a full-fledged architect today.}}</ref>\n<ref name=historic2009>{{cite web|author=Herold, Kendall |url=http://www.newscentralga.com/news/local/63483937.html |title=Ballard Hudson Middle School: A 'Historic' Dedication |publisher=News Central |date=October 4, 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318035540/http://www.newscentralga.com/news/local/63483937.html |archive-date=18 March 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n<ref name=ballard>{{cite web|author=League, Ellamae Ellis|title=Senior High School for Negro Boys and Girls for Bibb County Board of Education and Orphanage| date=1949 |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/file/11976 | quote=Ballard-Hudson High School in Bibb County was designed by Ellamae Ellis League, who opened her own architecture practice in Macon in 1934.
